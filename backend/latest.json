            "description": "FTSE 100 Slips as Gold Miners Lead Declines Amid Investor Caution On Monday, London's FTSE 100 broke its three-day winning streak, falling by 0.4% as investors moved to secure profits ahead of the new year. Gold miners were the primary contributors to the decline, with the sector seeing a 2% dip to its lowest trading level in more than three months, amid a drop in gold prices.Despite losses, the FTSE 100 is poised to achieve its fourth successive year of gains, while the FTSE 250 is on track for its second. Several FTSE 350 sectors experienced downturns, yet banks and travel/leisure stocks managed a modest 0.3% increase. Anticipated light trading volumes due to a holiday-shortened week add to the caution.Looking forward, investors face uncertainty as Donald Trump re-enters the U.S. political arena, possibly altering tariff strategies. Additionally, there’s scrutiny over UK Financial Minister Rachel Reeves' budget announcements and the BoE’s potential monetary policies, following last year's interest rate cuts.",

            "description": "The world is evolving, and so is the field of cyberattacks. In this ever evolving world, the topic of privacy is often talked about. Some people take it very seriously, and some have a chill approach towards it. The name Apple is one that has always been a part of the topic of privacy. It has long been championed as the company that makes the safest smartphones in the market.Apple has long emphasised its commitment to user privacy across its products and services, even launching the \"Privacy. That's Apple\" campaign in 2019. However, a recent revelation by developer Jeff Johnson has cast doubt on this narrative. In a blog post dated December 28, Johnson disclosed that a feature called \"Enhanced Visual Search,\" automatically enabled on iPhones running iOS 18 and Macs with macOS Sequoia, shares photo data with Apple without explicit user consent.ALSO READ | Samsung Galaxy S25 Leaks: Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, Galaxy S25 Ultra Tipped To Get Seamless A/B UpdatesThis functionality is designed to help users identify landmarks in photos and provide contextual information. It works in two stages: first, an on-device machine learning model scans the photo to identify regions of interest (ROI), such as landmarks. It then creates a vector embedding, which is sent to Apple for comparison with its database to determine the landmark. While Apple doesn't access full photo files, this feature effectively scans all images in the gallery, raising concerns about how much data is shared when the option is active.ALSO READ | Year Ender 2024: Looking Back At The Top AI Stories This Year That'll Take Us ForwardHere's How You Can Disable Enhanced Visual SearchOn iPhone:Go to SettingsClick on AppsClick on PhotosScroll down to the bottom and disable Enhanced Visual SearchOn Mac:Open the Photos appGo to Settings and disable Enhanced Visual Search",

Be it any small traditional function or marriage, gold remains essential for Indians. As women adorn this precious metal on a daily basis and often purchase it, their holding has increased. This has been further increased by a tradition of passing over the yellow metal to the next generation leading to add-ons. Accordingly, the amount of gold held by Indian women is the highest in the world. According to a World Gold Council report, Indian women hold 24,000 tons of cumulative gold.",

            "description": "Picture this: a world where a spelling bee teaches us to pronounce a luxury fashion brand, a hockey legend gets immortalised on a tribute wall, and a museum featuring sculptures of breasts mesmerises with its audio-visual splendour. Welcome to 2024, a year where advertising didn’t just sell products—it tried to outdo the creative precedence.From the poignant to the playful, brands embraced bold storytelling, clever insights, and fresh perspectives to leave a lasting mark on our minds and hearts.Take Zomato, for instance, which used its platform to champion environmental awareness and celebrate sporting legends, proving that advertising could have both soul and sizzle. Or BMW, which paired Christopher Walken’s eccentric charm with Usher’s smooth moves to turn a Super Bowl slot into a laugh-out-loud joyride.And humour? It wasn’t just a punchline—it became a trend. From the tongue-in-cheek genius of CeraVe’s “Michael CeraVe” ad to Swiggy’s delightful “Chawal vs. Chawla” campaign, laughter made its grand comeback in 2024. Cannes Lions even created a humour sub-category, officially recognising what audiences already knew: ads that make you chuckle and stick with you.But it wasn’t all jokes and jingles. There were ads that tugged at heartstrings too. Apple’s “Don’t Let Me Go” captured the universal human experience of losing something precious with a dose of exaggerated hilarity, while Nanhi Kali’s “Lessons from a Football” turned a simple game into a poignant metaphor for life’s biggest lessons.In terms of visual storytelling, Zivame’s “The Museum of Boobs” offered a visual feast with its use of shadows and contrast and the vivacious interplay between colours and mood-defining lighting. The amalgamation of intricate set design and subtle social commentary made for a novel mise-en-scene. The common thread running through these campaigns? They transcended the transactional. These weren’t just ads; they were stories, moments, and movements that sparked conversations and aimed to inspire change.As we turn 2024’s penultimate page, we asked industry luminaries to choose the ads that stood out to them in the year—both national and international. From heartfelt tributes to mischievous wordplay, this is a collection on how to captivate, connect, and create. After all, the best ads don’t just sell—they make us feel, think, and remember. Let’s revisit the magic that placed 2024 in contention for a noteworthy year in advertising history books.Lishoy George, Chief Creative Officer, Creativeland Asia “This year, a few ads really struck a chord with me. Nationally, Nanhi Kali: Lessons from a Football was a standout. It’s such a beautifully written and shot piece, showing how sports can teach powerful life lessons—teamwork, perseverance, and resilience. It’s not just an ad; it’s a story about how football becomes a metaphor for change, and it stayed with me long after I watched it.On a lighter note, Swiggy Instamart’s InstaSanta ad was pure fun! The way they used Sukhbir’s “Ho Ho Ho” track and gave it a festive twist was nothing short of genius. It brought a smile to my face and felt like the perfect blend of nostalgia and celebration.Internationally, Coca-Cola’s Recycle Me campaign was brilliant. A crushed Coke can with the distorted logo and the simple message, “Recycle Me,” broke all the usual brand rules but made such a strong statement. It was bold, purposeful, and visually unforgettable.These ads reminded me of the magic of storytelling in its many forms.”Mitesh Kothari, Co-founder and CCO, White Rivers Media“2024 has been a masterclass in blending creativity with technology. This year, several campaigns – national and international – have set benchmarks, reminding us why advertising is about insight as well as impact. Brands have elevated their game, moving beyond the transactional to create experiences that resonate deeply with audiences.On the national stage, Zomato stood out with its engaging and meaningful storytelling. Whether it was the brand’s World Environment Day campaign weaving environmental consciousness into a compelling narrative through impactful DVCs, or dedicating a tribute wall to hockey legend P.R. Sreejesh, Zomato showcased a knack for marrying purpose with storytelling.View this post on InstagramA post shared by White Rivers Media (@whiteriversmedia)Internationally too, brands delivered creative excellence. The CeraVe 'Michael CeraVe' Super Bowl ad, a personal favourite, was a perfect example of wit meeting relevance. By cleverly playing on the name similarity between actor Michael Cera and the skincare brand, the ad struck a chord with audiences, blending satire with a clear message about the product’s benefits.On the other hand, BMW’s 'Talkin' Like Walken' brought together Christopher Walken and Usher in a humorous celebration of the brand’s iconic 'Ultimate Driving Machine' slogan. The interplay of celebrity appeal and sharp dialogue turned the ad into one of the most memorable moments of the Super Bowl, capturing BMW’s commitment to blending performance with personality.These campaigns are united by their ability to evoke emotion and engagement. Whether through humour, innovation or purpose, they reflect the evolving landscape of advertising – a space where creativity and meaning coexist. 2024 reminded us that the best ads don’t just tell stories; they create moments, spark conversations and inspire action.”Prashant Gopalakrishnan, Founding Partner, Talented\"One of the standout trends in 2024 advertising was the welcome influx of humor. For too long, brands have been taking themselves too seriously, making this shift a refreshing change. International brands like CeraVe (who partnered with Michael Cera in a clever move) and Indian brands like Swiggy (with their amusing \"Chawal vs Chawla\" campaign) showcased the effective use of humor in advertising. This trend was further validated by the introduction of a humor sub-category at the Cannes Lions awards. It's clear that humor in advertising is finally being taken seriously, and I couldn't be more thrilled about it.\"Satbir Singh, Founder & Chief Creative Officer, Thinkstr.in“While, like every year, this year too has its fair share of brilliant advertising, for me one of the standout ones has been the Loewe Decades of Confusion ad.Most fashion brands have names that are hard to pronounce as they are of non-English European origin. Loewe is no different. They've addressed this with a clever ad set in a Spelling Bee situation. Audrey Plaza stars in this commercial written by Dan Levy of Schitt's Creek fame. It uses a time lapse format to show Spelling Bee participants struggling with the pronunciation and spelling through years.In the end, you know how it's done. And that it's Low-eh-way.That's the way, Loewe!” Sumanto Chattopadhyay, Independent Creative Director“The Specsavers sponsorship idents for the British soap opera Emmerdale are the standout campaign of 2024 for me. Not because they reflect some deep, meaningful brand purpose or terribly insightful strategy but because, after a long time, it was refreshing to see some genuinely funny ads.Specsavers is an international retailer that sells glasses, hearing aids and provides other services relating to eye and hearing care. They have a history of advertising based on people seeing or hearing things incorrectly, leading to hilarious situations—with the tagline “Should have gone to Specsavers.”Emmerdale is an iconic soap opera that has been running in the UK since the 1970s. Specsavers got award-winning comedy director Ollie Parsons to make a series of 15 sponsorship idents for the show this year. What I love about them is that they convey the Specsavers message in really short duration while retaining the brand’s trademark humour. Aptly, the idents are like mini soap operas themselves—starting out as seemingly dramatic scenarios that turn out to be laugh-inducing misunderstandings resulting from poor vision or hearing.The ones that work best are related to poor vision—perhaps because they dovetail more effortlessly with the message inherent in the brand name Specsavers. In one of them, an angry woman storms into a restaurant where her husband is seated, picks up a drink and splashes his face with it saying, “How could you do this to me, Barry?” The only thing is, she’s got the wrong man. She realises her mistake—as do we, the viewers—when her husband calls out to her from another table. It ends with the simple message “Specsavers sponsors Emmerdale.” There’s no other copy, no clutter.Long live such short and sweet ads!”Swati Kapoor, Creative Director, Toaster India“The Apple, don’t let me go film was super entertaining, simple and universally relatable. If an ad makes you feel ‘oh this is so true’, I think it’s done its job. Imagine if you find yourself in a moment like that and think of an ad. This kind of an effect is very rare, but seems possible with this commercial. Exaggerated to the right end, funny throughout and sharp about just one message. Apple advertising nails that and in fact is a benchmark for crisp, fresh storytelling even on mundane features.In today’s time, the expectation from a creative piece is a lot - make it direct but make it buzz worthy, should get downloads but should also get shares. As a result, creatives end up trying too hard. The line between zabardast and zabardasti is a fine one and often gets blurry for a lot of creative folks. But then an ad like Supermoney - Meh rewards, just by sticking to the basic principles of advertising, ticks all boxes.A simple insight, a fun creative device, slick execution and done!For me, it belonged in the same league of buzz worthy ads yet broke the clutter of the loud, gimmicky ideas that now almost feel like a template.”",

            "description": "सिगरेट से होने वाले नुकसान को लेकर जो लोग काम करते हैं उन्होंने साल 2025 तक चेन स्मोकर को इस आदत को छोड़ने का आग्रह किया है. ऐसा इसलिए कहा है क्योंकि रिसर्चर ने पाया है कि सिगरेट पीने से जिंदगी के 20 मिनट कम हो जाते हैं. यूनिवर्सिटी कॉलेज लंदन के शोधकर्ताओं ने पाया कि औसतन एक सिगरेट एक व्यक्ति के जीवन से लगभग 20 मिनट कम कर देती है, जिसका मतलब है कि 20 सिगरेट का एक पैकेट एक व्यक्ति के जीवन को लगभग सात घंटे कम कर सकता है.एक सिगरेट जिंदगी के 20 मिनट कर देता है कमविश्लेषण के अनुसार अगर एक धूम्रपान करने वाला व्यक्ति प्रतिदिन 10 सिगरेट पीता है, तो वह 8 जनवरी तक जीवन के एक पूरे दिन के नुकसान को रोक सकता है. अगर वह 5 फरवरी तक धूम्रपान छोड़ देता है, तो वह अपने जीवन की प्रत्याशा को एक सप्ताह तक बढ़ा सकता है और अगर वह 5 अगस्त तक धूम्रपान छोड़ देता है, तो एक पूरा महीना बढ़ा सकता है.सिरगरेट नहीं पीते हैं तो 50 दिन खोने से बच जाएंगेमूल्यांकन में पाया गया कि साल के अंत तक, वह जीवन के 50 दिन खोने से बच सकता है.यूसीएल के अल्कोहल और तंबाकू अनुसंधान समूह की एक प्रमुख शोध साथी डॉ. सारा जैक्सन ने कहा, आम तौर पर लोग जानते हैं कि धूम्रपान हानिकारक है, लेकिन वे यह कम आंकते हैं कि यह कितना हानिकारक है. औसतन, धूम्रपान करने वाले जो धूम्रपान नहीं छोड़ते हैं, वे जीवन का लगभग एक दशक खो देते हैं। यह 10 साल का कीमती समय, जीवन के पल और प्रियजनों के साथ मील के पत्थर हैं.धूम्रपान दुनिया में बीमारी और मृत्यु के प्रमुख रोकथाम योग्य कारणों में से एक है, जो लंबे समय से इसका सेवन करने वाले दो-तिहाई लोगों की जान ले लेता है. यह यू.के. में हर साल लगभग 80,000 मौतों और इंग्लैंड में कैंसर से होने वाली सभी मौतों का एक चौथाई हिस्सा है.ब्रिटिश डॉक्टर्स स्टडी का खुलासास्वास्थ्य विभाग द्वारा कमीशन किया गया यह अध्ययन ब्रिटिश डॉक्टर्स स्टडी के नवीनतम डेटा पर आधारित है, जो 1951 में धूम्रपान के प्रभावों पर दुनिया के पहले बड़े अध्ययनों में से एक के रूप में शुरू हुआ था, और मिलियन वूमेन स्टडी, जिसने 1996 से महिलाओं के स्वास्थ्य पर नज़र रखी है.यह भी पढ़ें: दोस्त हो आसपास तो दूर होगा हर गम, यारी आपसे दूर करेगी हर बीमारी, जानें क्या कहती है रिसर्चजर्नल ऑफ़ एडिक्शन में पब्लिश रिपोर्ट क्या कहती हैं?जबकि 2000 में BMJ में पहले के एक आकलन में पाया गया था कि औसतन एक सिगरेट से जीवन प्रत्याशा लगभग 11 मिनट कम हो जाती है, जर्नल ऑफ़ एडिक्शन में प्रकाशित नवीनतम विश्लेषण इस आंकड़े को लगभग दोगुना करके 20 मिनट कर देता है - पुरुषों के लिए 17 मिनट और महिलाओं के लिए 22 मिनट.जैक्सन ने गार्जियन को बताया कि कुछ लोग सोच सकते हैं कि उन्हें जीवन के कुछ साल खोने से कोई फर्क नहीं पड़ता, क्योंकि बुढ़ापे में अक्सर पुरानी बीमारी या विकलांगता होती है. लेकिन धूम्रपान जीवन के अंत में अस्वस्थ अवधि को कम नहीं करता है. यह मुख्य रूप से मध्य जीवन के अपेक्षाकृत स्वस्थ वर्षों को खा जाता है, जिससे अस्वस्थता की शुरुआत होती है. इसका मतलब है कि 60 साल धूम्रपान करने वाले का स्वास्थ्य प्रोफ़ाइल आमतौर पर 70 वर्षीय गैर-धूम्रपान करने वाले के समान होगा.Disclaimer: खबर में दी गई कुछ जानकारी मीडिया रिपोर्ट्स पर आधारित है. आप किसी भी सुझाव को अमल में लाने से पहले संबंधित विशेषज्ञ से सलाह जरूर लें.यह भी पढ़ें : नींद के लिए खा रहे हैं गोलियां, तुरंत छोड़ दें वरना किडनी-लिवर से हाथ धो बैठेंगे",

            "description": "मेलबर्न टेस्ट में यशस्वी जायसवाल के विकेट पर थर्ड अंपायर के फैसले पर विवाद हो गया। चौथे टेस्ट के आखिरी दिन ऑस्ट्रेलियन कप्तान कमिंस ने अपनी गेंद पर यशस्वी के खिलाफ कैच की अपील की। ग्राउंड अंपायर ने नॉट आउट दिया, लेकिन ऑस्ट्रेलिया ने DRS लिया और थर्ड अंपायर ने यशस्वी को आउट करार दिया। DRS में स्निको मीटर में दिखाया गया कि गेंद बल्ले से नहीं टकराई और कोई आवाज भी नहीं हुई। इसके बावजूद थर्ड अंपायर ने यशस्वी को आउट करार दिया। इस फैसले पर यशस्वी ने ग्राउंड अंपायर से सवाल भी किया, लेकिन फैसला नहीं बदला गया। थर्ड अंपायर ने यह फैसला ऐसे वक्त लिया, जब टीम इंडिया पर हार का खतरा मंडरा रहा था और यशस्वी 84 रन बनाकर एक ओर से छोर संभाले हुए थे। इस फैसले के बाद ग्राउंड में मौजूद इंडियन फैंस ने चीटर-चीटर के नारे लगाए। 4 तस्वीरों में अंपायर का फैसला 1. यशस्वी के शॉट पर DRS लिया गया 2. स्निकोमीटर में गेंद और बल्ले का संपर्क नहीं 3. विजुअल एविडेंस में गेंद का डिफ्लेक्शन दिखा 4. फील्ड अंपायर ने सुनाया थर्ड अंपायर का फैसला फैसले पर विवाद क्यों, 5 सवाल-जवाब में समझें... 1. थर्ड अंपायर ने किस आधार पर दिया फैसला?थर्ड अंपायरिंग की जिम्मेदारी बांग्लादेश के अंपायर शरफुदुल्लाह संभाल रहे हैं। उनके सामने फैसला लेने के लिए दो एविडेंस रखे गए। पहला स्निको मीटर और दूसरा विजुअल एविडेंस। शरफुदुल्लाह को स्निको मीटर में गेंद और बल्ले में कोई संपर्क नहीं दिखाई दिया, क्योंकि कोई आवाज नहीं आई। लेकिन गेंद की गल्व्स से करीबी और डिफ्लेक्शन के आधार पर अंपायर ने यशस्वी को आउट करार दे दिया। 2. गावस्कर ने फैसला गलत क्यों बताया?मैच के दौरान कमेंट्री कर रहे सुनील गावस्कर ने कहा, \"आप फैसला लेते वक्त टेक्नोलॉजी का इस्तेमाल कर रहे हैं। स्निको मीटर में साफ दिख रहा था कि आउट नहीं है। यह एकदम गलत फैसला है। आप बहुत दबाव वाली स्थितियों में दबाव वाला फैसला दिया है। अंपायर को कोई निश्चित प्रमाण नहीं मिला कि यशस्वी आउट हैं, ऐसे में उन्हें आउट दिया जाना एकदम गलत है।\" 3. ICC के नियम क्या कहते हैं? 4. राहुल के फैसले में स्निको आधार तो यशस्वी में क्यों नहीं? 5. यशस्वी के विकेट के बाद इंडिया कैसे टेस्ट हारी?यशस्वी 71वें ओवर में आउट हुए। टीम इंडिया का स्कोर 7 विकेट पर 140 रन था। अगले 8 ओवर में भारत 155 रन पर ऑल आउट हो गई। टीम इंडिया मेलबर्न टेस्ट हार गई। बॉर्डर-गावस्कर ट्रॉफी में 5 टेस्ट मैच होने हैं। 4 टेस्ट के बाद ऑस्ट्रेलिया सीरीज में 2-1 से आगे हो गई है। इंडिया की हार की वजह टॉप ऑर्डर बैटर्स के खराब परफॉर्मेंस रही। यशस्वी के अलावा, शुरुआती 3 बल्लेबाज रोहित शर्मा (9), केएल राहुल (0) और विराट कोहली (5) दहाई के आंकड़े तक नहीं पहुंच पाए। ऋषभ पंत का एक खराब शॉट भी टर्निंग पॉइंट बन गया। यशस्वी ने ऋषभ पंत के साथ 88 रन की साझेदारी कर टीम को शुरुआती झटकों से उबारा, लेकिन पंत ने खराब शॉट खेलकर अपना विकेट गंवा दिया। मैच का पूरा हाल जानने के लिए क्लिक करें... यशस्वी का विकेट, निराशा, गुस्सा और जश्न 1. यशस्वी के कैच पर ऑस्ट्रेलियंस की अपील 3. थर्ड अंपायर के फैसले पर यशस्वी खफा 3. ऑस्ट्रेलियंस ने विकेट मिलने पर जश्न मनाया 4. निराशा में पवेलयिन लौटे यशस्वी जायसवाल",

            "description": "Punjabi superstar Diljit Dosanjh performed at the Sarusajai Sports Complex in Guwahati on Sunday as part of his Dil-Luminati Tour 2024. The singer dedicated his concert to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who passed away on Thursday. In a heartfelt tribute, Diljit shared a video on Instagram where he paid respects to Singh, describing him as a man of grace and recalling one of the former PM's famous poetic statements. View this post on Instagram A post shared by DILJIT DOSANJH (@diljitdosanjh) During the event, Diljit expressed his admiration for Manmohan Singh, stating that he lived a simple and dignified life, refraining from responding negatively even in the challenging sphere of politics. He recited a shayari often associated with Singh: “Hazaron jawabo se meri khamoshi acchi, na jane kitne sawalo ki aabru dhak leti hai” (My silence is better than a thousand answers, as it shields the dignity of countless questions). Diljit remarked that this philosophy was something the youth, including himself, should strive to embody.

He reflected on the importance of staying focused on one's goals despite negativity, explaining that every challenge serves as a test of one's character. He emphasized that even those who speak ill of others can be viewed as instruments of divine testing, teaching valuable lessons about self-restraint and perseverance. Diljit also highlighted Manmohan Singh’s historic achievement as the first Sikh to have his signature on Indian currency, showcasing the former PM’s significant contributions. Sharing the tribute video, Diljit captioned it: “Today’s Concert is dedicated to Dr. Manmohan Singh Ji DIL-LUMINATI TOUR Year 24.” Fans responded with overwhelming admiration. One commented, “Ek hi dil hai, paaji, kitni baar jeetoge? Pyaar hi pyaar, respect hi respect!” Another remarked, “Indirect answer to AP Dhillon,” hinting at an ongoing feud between the two artists. Diljit’s Dil-Luminati Tour India leg will conclude on December 31 in Ludhiana. The tour began in October with performances in Delhi, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Pune, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Indore, Chandigarh, and Mumbai.",

            "description": "Hackers were reportedly able to modify several Chrome extensions with malicious code this month after gaining access to admin accounts through a phishing campaign. The cybersecurity company Cyberhaven shared in a blog post this weekend that its Chrome extension was compromised on December 24 in an attack that appeared to be “targeting logins to specific social media advertising and AI platforms.” A few other extensions were hit as well, going back to mid-December, Reuters reported. According to Nudge Security’s Jaime Blasco, that includes ParrotTalks, Uvoice and VPNCity.Cyberhaven notified its customers on December 26 in an email seen by TechCrunch, which advised them to revoke and rotate their passwords and other credentials. The company’s initial investigation of the incident found that the malicious extension targeted Facebook Ads users, with a goal of stealing data such as access tokens, user IDs and other account information, along with cookies. The code also added a mouse click listener. “After successfully sending all the data to the [Command & Control] server, the Facebook user ID is saved to browser storage,” Cyberhaven said in its analysis. “That user ID is then used in mouse click events to help attackers with 2FA on their side if that was needed.”Cyberhaven said it first detected the breach on December 25 and was able to remove the malicious version of the extension within an hour. It’s since pushed out a clean version.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/hackers-injected-malicious-code-into-several-chrome-extensions-in-recent-attack-220648155.html?src=rss",

            "description": "MELBOURNE, Australia and INDIANAPOLIS, Dec. 30, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited (ASX: TLX; Nasdaq: TLX, Telix, the Company) today announces that it has submitted its Biologics License Application (BLA) to the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for TLX250-CDx (Zircaix®[1], 89Zr- girentuximab) kidney cancer imaging[2]. TLX250-CDx is an investigational PET[3] drug product for the non-invasive diagnosis and characterisation of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common and aggressive form of kidney cancer. If approved, TLX250-CDx will be the first and only targeted PET agent specifically for kidney cancer to be commercially available in the U.S., further building on Telix's successful urology imaging franchise. The FDA is expected to advise the PDUFA[4] goal date following the 60-day administrative review of the application. Kevin Richardson, Chief Executive Officer, Precision Medicine at Telix, stated, \"We are pleased to be progressing the BLA for TLX250-CDx, which has been granted Breakthrough designation, and may therefore be eligible for priority review. Telix continues to target a full U.S. commercial launch in 2025 addressing a major unmet medical need for patients with suspected ccRCC.\" About TLX250-CDx TLX250-CDx (Zircaix®1) is an investigational PET agent that is under development for the diagnosis and characterisation of ccRCC. Telix's pivotal Phase III ZIRCON trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03849118) evaluating TLX250-CDx in 300 patients, of whom 284 were evaluable, met all primary and secondary endpoints, including showing 86% sensitivity and 87% specificity and a 93% positive-predictive value for ccRCC across three independent radiology readers[5].

Form 7 Rule 16 (2) का मतलबआपने देखा होगा कि आपके ड्राइविंग लाइसेंस के पीछे की तरफ Form 7 Rule 16 (2) लिखा है, तो इसका मतलब है कि आपका स्मार्ट कार्ड लेमिनेटेड और चिप युक्त है, जिसमें आपकी हर डिटेल छिपी है. वाहन चेकिंग के दौरान महज इस चिप को स्कैन करने के साथ ही आपकी सारी डिटेल आ जाएगी.स्मार्ट कार्ड के लिए जब भी आप अप्लाई करेंगे, तो आपको Form 7 Rule 16 (1) और Form 7 Rule 16 (2) दोनों मिलेगा. इसमें 1 बिना चिप लगा हुआ स्मार्ट कार्ड होता है और 2 चिप के साथ स्मार्ट कार्ड होता है. कुल मिलाकर अगर आपको लेमिनेटेड कार्ड या स्मार्ट कार्ड के लिए अप्लाई करना है, तो आपको Form 7 भरना होगा. इसके बाद जब आपको कार्ड इश्यू होगा, तो इस पर Form 7 Rule 16 (2) या (1) लिखा हुआ रहेगा. टैम्पर प्रूफ होता है स्मार्ट कार्डड्राइविंग लाइसेंस क्षेत्रीय परिवहन कार्यालय द्वारा जारी किया जाता है. स्मार्ट कार्ड ड्राइविंग लाइसेंस में लाइसेंसर की बायोमेट्रिक जानकारी को आरटीओ (Regional Transport Office) के सर्वर में स्टोर कर लिया जाता है. प्लास्टिक का यह कार्ड टैम्पर प्रूफ होता है यानी कि इसके साथ कोई छेड़छाड़ नहीं किया जा सकता है. इसमें एम्बेडेड माइक्रोप्रोसेसर चिप 64 केबी मेमोरी की होती है.इस तरह से करें अप्लाईअगर आपको ड्राइविंग लाइसेंस के लिए अप्लाई करना है, तो भारत सरकार के सड़क परिवहन और राजमार्ग मंत्रालय की परिवहन सेवा की आधिकारिक वेबसाइट (parivahan.gov.in) पर जाना होगा. इसके बाद ऑनलाइन सर्विसेज के ड्रॉप डाउन मेन्यू पर जाकर ड्राइविंग लाइसेंस सर्विस पर क्लिक करना होगा. इसके बाद अपना राज्य और आरटीओ एरिया सिलेक्ट करना होगा. इसके बाद अपनी सारी जानकारी भरें और आईडी प्रूफ, एज प्रूफ और निवास प्रमाण पत्र को स्कैन के जरिए अपलोड करें. डॉक्यूमेंट के बाद फोटो और सिग्नेचर को अपलोड करें. इसके बाद अगर जरूरी है तो डीएल टेस्ट स्लॉट बुक करें और फीस भर दें. इसके बाद टेस्टिंग के लिए तय समयानुसार आरटीओ पर जाएं. टेस्ट में पास हो गए, तो डीएल पोस्ट के जरिए आपके एड्रेस तक पहुंचा दिया जाएगा. ये भी पढ़ें: क्यों लगी होती है ज्यादातर एटीएम और क्रेडिट कार्ड पर उड़ते हुए कबूतर की स्टिकर?",

            "description": "विश्व हिंदू परिषद मातृशक्ति, दुर्गा वाहिनी मालवा प्रांत के 'शक्ति संगम' के अवसर पर साध्वी ऋतंभरा दीदी ने मीडिया से चर्चा करते हुए कहा कि हमारे तीर्थ स्थल और आराधना स्थल पर हिंदू समाज का ही व्यापार होना चाहिए। विधर्मियों को इसका अधिकार नहीं होना चाहिए। उन्होंने कहा कि यदि आप हज करने जाएं और मुसलमान न हों, तो आपको वहां प्रवेश नहीं मिलेगा। फिर हमारे यहां इतनी छूट क्यों दी जाती है? यह सबसे दुर्भाग्यपूर्ण है कि लोग छद्म नाम से हमारे यहां व्यापार कर रहे हैं। साध्वी ऋतंभरा ने कहा कि हमारे यहां देवों की आराधना के दौरान खान-पान की पवित्रता सबसे महत्वपूर्ण होती है। यदि यह व्यवस्था विधर्मियों के हाथ में रहेगी, तो कौन गारंटी देगा कि उसमें पवित्रता है या नहीं। इसलिए इसमें तुरंत बदलाव होना चाहिए। हमारे सभी तीर्थ स्थलों और आराधना स्थलों पर केवल उन्हीं का होना चाहिए जो भगवान को भगवान मानते हैं, भारत भूमि को माँ मानते हैं। उन्होंने कहा, \"जिनके विचित्र आचरण और व्यवहार हैं, उनके लिए यह उचित नहीं है। यह देखकर लगता है कि हमारे धार्मिक स्थलों की पवित्रता बनाए रखने के लिए तुरंत कार्यवाही होनी चाहिए।\" मोहन भागवत के बयान पर दी प्रतिक्रिया साध्वी ऋतंभरा ने मोहन भागवत के बयान पर कहा कि हमें कानून के माध्यम से अपने प्राचीन परंपराओं का पालन करने का अधिकार है। भारत में मंदिरों के ध्वस्त होने और हिंदू समाज पर हुए अत्याचारों के संदर्भ में उन्होंने कहा कि यह प्रयास उसी अतीत को सामने लाने का है। स्त्रियों की सशक्तता पर दिया जोर \"राजनेता हमारी रक्षा करने थोड़ी आएंगे। यदि अन्याय हो रहा है, तो उसका विरोध संगठित होकर करना होगा। राज्य अपना काम करता है और राष्ट्र अपना। स्त्री न अबला है, न असहाय; वह स्वयं सिद्ध और सक्षम है। आज यहाँ दुर्गाओं के जोश को देखकर यह विश्वास हो गया है कि स्त्री अपनी रक्षा स्वयं कर सकती है।\" उन्होंने कहा, \"संस्कारों का प्रबल होना बहुत जरूरी है। हर घर के अंदर संस्कारों का वातावरण बनाना चाहिए। आज दुर्गा वाहिनी और मातृशक्ति का संगम हुआ। यह संगम भगवती माता अहिल्याबाई होलकर के पुण्य स्मरण और मातृ वंदना के लिए था। इस अवसर पर हजारों दुर्गाएँ यहाँ एकत्रित हुईं।\" साध्वी ऋतुंभरा ने कहा, \"हमने यह संकल्प लिया है कि देश और धर्म पर जो भी चुनौतियाँ आएंगी, उन्हें हम स्वीकार करेंगे। भारत की भूमि सनातनी भूमि है और इसकी परंपरा में प्रदूषण नहीं होना चाहिए।\" उन्होंने देश के भीतर और बाहर हो रही घटनाओं पर भी चिंता व्यक्त की। उन्होंने कहा, \"देश में होने वाली बहुत सी घटनाएँ मन को उद्वेलित कर देती हैं। बांग्लादेश में हिंदू स्त्रियों के साथ हो रहे अत्याचारों को देखकर यह लगता है कि स्त्री को सशक्त और स्वयं सिद्ध होना जरूरी है। उसे अपनी रक्षा स्वयं करने में सक्षम बनना होगा।\" विश्व हिंदू परिषद मातृशक्ति, दुर्गा वाहिनी की ओर से मालवा प्रांत की लगभग 25,000 माताएं और बहनें एकत्रित हुईं। उनका आयोजन त्रिवेणी संग्रहालय के पास महाकालेश्वर मंदिर के निशुल्क अन्नक्षेत्र में हुआ। यहां से शौर्य यात्रा प्रारंभ हुई, जो महाकाल लोक से होते हुए गुदरी, पटनी बाजार, गोपाल मंदिर, छत्री चौक, सराफा, कण्ठाल चौराहा, कोयला फाटक होकर सामाजिक न्याय परिसर पहुंची थी।",

Gupta, a native of Silpara, Behala, managed his covert operations under the guise of a travel agency in Sakherbazar.Gupta was allegedly responsible for producing fake passports, with the forgery network extending to visa issuance, as revealed by a police officer to PTI. Previous police actions led to the seizure of counterfeit documents and hardware equipment, further exposing the racket's extensive reach and its focus on facilitating illegal identity acquisitions for Bangladeshis.",

            "description": "Sikh activist Bakshish Singh narrowly escaped unhurt after unidentified assailants opened fire at his car in Punjab’s Patiala district, police said on Sunday. According to ABP Sanjha, unidentified assailants fired at Bakshish Singh near Patiala's new bus stand when he was returning from his village, Najamwala. The incident occurred around 1:30 am on the Patiala South Bypass road near Urban Estate. Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Nanak Singh confirmed that an investigation is underway and an FIR has been lodged at the Urban Estate police station. According to police sources cited by news agency PTI, Baba Bakshish Singh, known for raising various issues, including the release of Bandi Singhs (Sikh prisoners), was returning to his residence in SST Nagar from Gurdwara Karhali Sahib, near Samana, when his car was attacked. PTI sources stated that two or three rounds were fired at Bakshish Singh's vehicle, but he managed to escape unscathed. Initial reports suggested that the assailants arrived in vehicles, including a Scorpio, a Brezza, and a Verna.

            "description": "Boosting Innovation: ESC Advocates Major Tax Cuts and Extended Support for R&D The Electronics and Computer Software Export Promotion Council (ESC) is advocating for significant changes to the Design Linked Incentive (DLI) scheme and tax policies to support the electronics sector. ESC argues these measures will stimulate research and development (R&D) and innovation among Indian corporates.In a recent meeting with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and top finance officials, ESC proposed substantial tax incentives. They recommend additional income tax reductions for corporations investing more than 3% of their turnover in R&D and filing patents in India, aligning with national innovation goals.ESC has also called for an extension of the DLI scheme until 2035, emphasizing its necessity due to the lengthy development cycles in electronics and semiconductor design. Additionally, ESC seeks a substantial funding increase and a 10-year tax holiday on sales of IP-driven products, encouraging investment in indigenous technology.",

            "description": "WhatsApp is introducing a reverse image search feature to combat misinformation. This feature, available on WhatsApp Web Beta and soon on Android, allows users to verify images shared with them by searching them on Google. Additionally, a new in-app document scanning feature has been added to the iOS app. WhatsApp's new reverse picture search function aims to combat the spread of false information on the internet. WhatsApp Web Beta now features the new functionality, which WABetainfo first discovered for the WhatsApp Android beta app. With Google's assistance, WhatsApp is reportedly going to enable users to verify a picture that has been shared with them. Ideally, the new capability would assist users in determining whether the shared image has been altered, distorted, or even removed from its context. Also Read | Lava Yuva 2 with notification light, 50MP camera, 5000mAh battery launched | Check specs, price The good news is that WhatsApp will include a button to start the reverse image search process directly from the online application, saving users from having to download the image to their desktop. WhatsApp will upload the image to Google with the user's consent and launch the default browser to begin the reverse image search procedure whenever the user chooses to look for the image online. However, Google will manage the entire reverse image search process, and WhatsApp won't have access to the image's contents.

Users may access a specific \"Scan\" option that turns on their device's camera whenever they visit the document-sharing menu. Users may see the scan and make changes after taking a picture of the document. Although the program recognizes margins automatically, users are still in complete control of manually adjusting them for the best possible framing and clarity.",

            "description": "गोंडा जिले में रोडवेज प्रशासन को डीजल की खपत और कमाई में हो रहे नुकसान को देखते हुए बड़ा फैसला लिया गया है। अब 25 से कम सवारी होने पर रोडवेज बसों का संचालन नहीं किया जाएगा। क्षेत्रीय प्रबंधक अरविंद कुमार ने आदेश जारी करते हुए साफ किया है कि बिना पर्याप्त सवारियों के बसें सड़कों पर नहीं दौड़ेंगी। रिपोर्ट के अनुसार, खाली बसों के संचालन के कारण रोडवेज विभाग को हर महीने लाखों रुपए का नुकसान हो रहा था। डीजल की अत्यधिक खपत और कम कमाई के चलते यह फैसला लिया गया है। क्षेत्रीय प्रबंधक ने निर्देश दिए हैं कि 50% से कम कमाई होने पर संबंधित बस के चालक और परिचालक की जिम्मेदारी तय की जाएगी और उनके खिलाफ कार्रवाई की जाएगी। नए निर्देश1. 25 से कम सवारी होने पर बसों का संचालन प्रतिबंधित।2. अगर बस लौटते समय सवारियां कम हों और आगे यात्री मिलने की संभावना कम हो, तो समयपाल और वरिष्ठ केंद्र प्रभारियों से वार्ता करना अनिवार्य।3. किसी विषम परिस्थिति में विशेष अनुमति के बिना बसों का संचालन नहीं होगा। कोऑर्डिनेशन पर जोरक्षेत्रीय प्रबंधक ने वरिष्ठ केंद्र प्रभारियों और समयपाल को निर्देश दिया है कि वे चालक और परिचालकों के साथ समन्वय बनाकर संचालन सुनिश्चित करें। अरविंद कुमार ने कहा, \"हमारे निर्देश का उद्देश्य डीजल की खपत और वित्तीय नुकसान को नियंत्रित करना है। यदि आदेश का पालन नहीं किया गया तो संबंधित स्टाफ पर सख्त कार्रवाई की जाएगी।\"",

            "description": "OnePlus could launch its second-generation foldable phone, presumably called the OnePlus Open 2, earlier than expected. The business is anticipated to unveil the foldable early next year, and several claims and leaks indicated that the Open 2 will be released by the second half of 2025. It is anticipated that the OnePlus Open 2 will be a rebranded Oppo Find N5, which will be available in the future weeks. Zhou Yibao, the product manager for Oppo, also stated that it will debut shortly in a social media exchange with a user. Rumor has it that it will be introduced in the first quarter of 2025, although there is no official launch date.

According to renders shared by Smartprix, the OnePlus Open 2 showcases a refined design with a larger circular camera module. This housing features a rearranged triple-camera setup in the top semicircle, accompanied by Hasselblad branding and an LED flash on the rear panel. The foldable is depicted in a sleek black finish with curved rear edges, measuring less than 10mm in thickness, potentially making it one of the slimmest foldable smartphones available. Regarding its technology, the Open 2 may be one of the first foldables to use Qualcomm's top processor, the Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC. It could also include a 50MP triple camera configuration. A circular periscope telephoto lens that supports optical zooms of up to three times might be one of these. Also Read | Xiaomi to introduce Redmi 14C as its first smartphone launch of 2025? Additionally, foldable screens with 2K+ resolution are reportedly a component of the OnePlus Open 2. Additionally, it could be able to use dual-cell batteries for three-stage wireless charging. In terms of appearance, the phone could resemble its predecessor in having a slimmer, lighter design with a glass or leather back. The foldable could feature a 5,900mAh battery with 80W wired fast charging support, ensuring prolonged use with minimal downtime. OnePlus 13 launch The OnePlus 12 is gaining attention because of a significant price reduction on Amazon as the company prepares for the January 7, 2025, worldwide and Indian debut of its next-generation flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 13. This makes it a desirable option for those on a tight budget looking for a high-end smartphone experience. The 12GB RAM and 256GB storage version of the OnePlus 12, which was first released in January 2024, is now discounted to Rs 59,999 from its initial launch price of Rs 64,999.
