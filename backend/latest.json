            "description": "Danone's Bold Move: Ditching Artificial Dyes for Healthier U.S. Yogurt Danone, the yogurt giant, is planning to eliminate artificial dyes from its U.S. products amidst growing health concerns and regulatory scrutiny. Shane Grant, CEO of Danone's Americas business, confirmed the initiative, aligning it with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s agenda to boost national health.Only 2% of Danone's U.S. portfolio contains artificial dyes, with popular items like Yo Crunch vanilla yogurt with M&Ms using them. The move is seen as a proactive step given increasing consumer awareness and related policy changes across American states.The Consumer Brands Association has also highlighted the industry's shift towards dye-free products. Despite reports of Kennedy's understanding with food manufacturers, no formal agreement exists. States like Arizona and West Virginia have already banned such dyes in school food, underscoring the trend's momentum.",

            "description": "Trump's Executive Order Targets NPR and PBS Funding President Donald Trump's administration has issued an executive order to eliminate federal funding for NPR and PBS, two key U.S. broadcasters. The decision is part of the administration's strategy to sanction organizations it perceives as political adversaries.The order demands that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting halt direct funding to PBS and NPR. While NPR plans to contest the order legally, PBS is exploring possible courses of action. Currently, a significant portion of their funding originates from non-federal sources, with Congress having already allocated $535 million to CPB for fiscal year 2025.The White House justifies the funding cuts by accusing NPR and PBS of using taxpayer money to promote indoctrination disguised as news. However, CPB's Patricia Harrison argues that Congress, not the president, has the authority over this funding. Civil liberties advocates express worries about potential impacts on free speech, as NPR and PBS explore alternatives to maintain their programming integrity.",

            "description": "Miami GP Secures Historic 10-Year F1 Extension In a significant move for Formula One's expansion in the United States, the Miami Grand Prix has secured a contract extension until 2041, making it the longest-running event on the F1 calendar.Formula One chief Stefano Domenicali hailed the agreement as an essential strategic milestone, emphasizing its role in the sport's growth, particularly in the booming U.S. market fueled by the popularity of Netflix's 'Drive to Survive' series. Domenicali underlined the importance of solidifying F1's presence in the States as a part of a broader expansion strategy.Red Bull's Christian Horner acknowledged the extension's lengthy duration, but noted its potential to fortify Formula One's position in America. Miami GP promoter Tom Garfinkel highlighted the local economic and cultural benefits, predicting a surge in fanbase growth and positioning Miami as a prominent motorsport hub.",

Experts, including Mel Robbins and researchers from the University of Oxford, explain that this habit confuses the brain by restarting sleep cycles it can’t complete, which may impact stress levels, immunity, and inflammation. Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and waking up naturally is recommended for better overall health.",

            "description": "Kuwait is cracking down on cryptocurrency miners throughout the country, as reported by Reuters. Officials have blamed the practice for blackouts and for causing stress on its power grid. The country started this crackdown just before the onset of summer, which experts say could reach scorching temperatures of 125 degrees Fahrenheit.Kuwait’s Ministry of Interior said in a statement that it has been conducting a \"wide-ranging\" security operation that targets homes suspected of being used for cryptocurrency mining. The government agency went on to say that crypto mining is illegal, as the country’s Capital Markets Authority banned the practice in 2023. Crypto trading was also banned at that time.The crackdown has been targeting homes in the Al-Wafrah region of Kuwait, which is located in the southern part of the country. The region’s electricity ministry has said that around 100 homes were being used for mining operations, often consuming up to 20 times the normal power levels. To that end, energy consumption in the area dropped by 55 percent following the operation, according to a government statement.It’s no secret that cryptocurrency mining gobbles up vast amounts of computing power and, as such, electricity. Kuwait isn’t the only country to regulate or outright ban the practice. Russia has banned crypto mining in several regions throughout the country. Kosovo outlawed the practice back in 2022 and Angola did the same in 2024. European countries like Iceland and Norway have strictly regulated the industry due to energy shortages.As for Kuwait, researchers at the University of Cambridge estimated that the country was responsible for just 0.05 percent of the world's bitcoin mining in 2022. Alex de Vries-Gao, founder of a research project that tracks crypto energy use, told Reuters that \"it only takes a very small share of the total bitcoin mining network to have a significant impact on the relatively small total electricity consumption of Kuwait.\"Recent data indicates that crypto mining accounts for almost 2.5 percent of the total energy consumption of the US. That’s approximately half of the energy used by the entire commercial sector of the US economy. But hey, at least we get some fake coins we can’t buy anything with for our trouble.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/kuwait-cracks-down-on-crypto-miners-to-cut-down-on-electricity-usage-161200772.html?src=rss",

            "description": "Supreme Court to Review Controversial UP Conversion Law The Supreme Court has decided to review a plea challenging the constitutionality of the 2024 amendments to Uttar Pradesh's law on unlawful religious conversion. Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justices Sanjay Kumar and K V Viswanathan noted arguments by senior lawyer S Muralidhar, who described sections of the Act as 'vague and overly broad', and claimed they violate free speech and religious propagation rights.The plea, submitted by Roop Rekha Verma among others, argues that the law's ambiguous wording violates Articles 14, 19, 21, and 25 of the Constitution by enabling arbitrary enforcement and lacking clear standards. The presumption of malintent behind conversions and a lack of procedural safeguards are central to the concerns raised.Challengers also argue the amendment expands who can file complaints without adequate procedural safeguards, disproportionately affects individuals practicing their faith, and risks wrongful prosecution. The Court will hear these arguments alongside other similar petitions on May 13, scrutinizing the law's alignment with constitutional rights.",

            "description": "SEBI ने ओला इलेक्ट्रिक के खिलाफ इनसाइडर ट्रेडिंग के आरोपों की जांच शुरू की है। एनडीटीवी की रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, ओला इलेक्ट्रिक ने अक्टूबर-दिसंबर 2024 के बीच इनसाइडर ट्रेडिंग और रिलेटेड पार्टी डील्स में नियमों का उलंघन किया है। यह मामला तब सामने आया, जब पहले ही ओला पर फरवरी 2025 की सेल्स रिपोर्ट में गड़बड़ी के आरोप लग चुके हैं। दरअसल, फरवरी 2025 में कंपनी ने दावा किया था कि उसने 25,000 इलेक्ट्रिक व्हीकल बेचे और इलेक्ट्रिक टू-व्हीलर में 28% मार्केट शेयर हासिल किया था। लेकिन सरकारी वेबसाइट VAHAN पर दर्ज आकड़ों के अनुसार फरवरी में ओला के सिर्फ 8,600 वाहनों का ही रजिस्ट्रेशन हुआ था। इस बड़े अंतर पर सेबी जांच कर रही है। केंद्रीय परिवहन मंत्रालय भी नोटिस दे चुका इससे पहले 25 अप्रैल को केंद्रीय परिवहन मंत्रालय ने ओला को शो-कॉज नोटिस जारी किया था। मंत्रालय ने 7 दिन के अंदर कई अहम सवालों के जवाब मांगे थे। नोटिस में ओला से इन सवालों के जवाब मांगे 22 अप्रैल को महाराष्ट्र में 121 स्टोर्स पर कार्रवाई के निर्देश दिए थे तीन दिन पहले महाराष्ट्र में ट्रांसपोर्ट विभाग ने ओला के 121 स्टोर्स बंद करने के निर्देश दिए हैं। ट्रांसपोर्ट विभाग ने ओला के 146 स्टोर्स की जांच की थी, इनमें 121 से ज्यादा स्टोर्स बिना ट्रेड सर्टिफिकेट के चल रहे थे। दरअसल, पिछले महीने RTO ने महाराष्ट्र में ओला के कई स्टोर्स पर छापेमारी की थी। स्टोर्स पर ट्रेड सर्टिफिकेट नहीं होने के चलते 192 व्हीकल्स को जब्त कर कारण बताओ नोटिस दिए गए थे। ओला इलेक्ट्रिक का शेयर 1 साल में 46% गिरा शुक्रवार को ओला इलेक्ट्रिक शेयर 0.33% की गिरवट के साथ 48.53 रुपए पर बंद हुआ। एक महीने में ओला का शेयर 10% से ज्यादा गिरा है। वहीं पिछले एक साल में शेयर 45% से ज्यादा टूटा है। ओला का मार्केट कैपिटल 22.14 हजार करोड़ रुपए है। ओला के स्टोर पर 4 बार हुई रेड ओला के स्टोर्स पर देशभर में RTO कार्रवाई हुई थी। अब तक महाराष्ट्र और मध्यप्रदेश के 32 स्टोर्स पर रेड पड़ चुकी है। इसके अलावा राजस्थान में कुछ स्टोर्स पर भी कार्रवाई की गई है। इसमें 50 से ज्यादा इलेक्ट्रिक गाड़ियों को जब्त किया जा चुका है। दूसरी कंपनियों की शिकायत के बाद कार्रवाई गुरुग्राम की प्रताप सिंह एंड एसोसिएट्स कंपनी ने ओला इलेक्ट्रिक और कुछ अन्य कंपनियों के खिलाफ ट्रेड सर्टिफिकेट नहीं होने की शिकायत दर्ज कराई थी। शिकायत के बाद महाराष्ट्र के ट्रांसपोर्ट अधिकारियों ने कार्रवाई की । ओला इलेक्ट्रिक ने कहा- रेड की कार्रवाई गलत और पक्षपातपूर्ण रेड की कार्रवाई पर ओला इलेक्ट्रिक के प्रवक्ता ने बताया था कि कोई वाहन जब्त नहीं किया गया है। इससे पहले ओला ने जांच को गलत और पक्षपातपूर्ण बताया था। प्रवक्ता ने कहा था कई राज्यों में ओला के डिस्ट्रीब्यूशन सेंटर्स और गोदामों में अनरजिस्टर्ड व्हीकल्स की इन्वेंट्री है। ये मोटर व्हीकल एक्ट के दिशानिर्देशों का पूरी तरह से पालन करती है और जरूरी मंजूरियां मौजूद हैं। कंपनी ने स्टोर्स पर रेड को लेकर कोई जानकारी नहीं दी थी।",

            "description": "BJP MP Claims Pakistan Behind Disappearance of 10,000 People Nishikant Dubey, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Member of Parliament, has made startling accusations against Pakistan, claiming that the Pakistan Army colluded with terrorists Hafiz Saeed and Dawood Ibrahim to eliminate Baluchis and protesters, resulting in the disappearance of approximately 10,000 individuals.Dubey's allegations come at a time of escalated diplomatic tension between India and Pakistan following the Pahalgam terrorist attack, which claimed 26 lives. In response to these developments, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's joint general secretary, Krishna Gopal, discussed the prevailing 'intolerance' in Pakistan, emphasizing the lack of social cohesion among various ethnic communities there.Addressing concerns during a book launch, RSS leader Krishna Gopal commented on the persisting divisions within Pakistan. Meanwhile, the Indian government has announced a series of retaliatory actions, including suspending the Indus Water Treaty to address Pakistan's support for terrorism. Union Home Minister Amit Shah reiterated the government's zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism, vowing to eradicate it entirely. (ANI)",

His arrest took place in Shamsher Nagar, Dhanbad, amid an ongoing investigation into the Jharkhand module of Hizb ut-Tahrir.Ammar, once jailed by Jodhpur Police in 2014, served a decade before securing bail in May 2024. Post-release, he allegedly resumed contact with Hizb ut-Tahrir operatives, uncovered during the recent interrogation of Ayan Javed by ATS, which led to his capture.This operation intensified on April 26, resulting in the arrest of four individuals with alleged links to Hizb ut-Tahrir and Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS). The ATS, acting on intelligence cues, recovered illegal arms and extremist materials, marking the first case post-HuT's 2024 ban under the UAPA Act.",

            "description": "Tensions Escalate Along India-Pakistan Border After Ceasefire Violations The Indian military has responded effectively to unprovoked small arms firing by the Pakistan Army across the Line of Control (LoC) on the night of May 1-2. The clashes occurred in areas opposite Kupwara, Baramulla, and Poonch districts, as well as the Naushera and Akhnoor sectors of Jammu and Kashmir, according to officials.This marks the eighth consecutive day of India's precise retaliations since the Pakistan Army's initial firing on April 25-26. The Indian Army remains resolute in its response, countering attacks across multiple regions including Kupwara, Uri, and Akhnoor sectors.Meanwhile, heightened security measures are underway in Jammu and Kashmir's Rajouri district following a recent terrorist attack. Joint search operations continue in various forests and along the borders to locate suspected terrorists.Security forces have set up vehicle check posts for thorough inspection of suspicious vehicles on highways and roads. Recently, the Director General of Military Operations from both countries engaged in talks over the hotline regarding Pakistan’s ceasefire violations, as per defense sources.India has issued a stern warning to Pakistan over these violations along the LoC and has imposed an airspace closure for all Pakistani-registered aircraft. The Ministry of Civil Aviation confirmed the closure, effective from April 30 to May 23, as a response to the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam where 26 people perished.",

            "description": "हम सभी ट्रेन से यात्रा करते हैं। सफर के दौरान अक्सर ही हमारा सामना TTE और RPF से होता रहता है। कई बार हम अनजाने में या किसी मजबूरी में बिना टिकट यात्रा करते हैं और पकड़े जाने पर घबरा जाते हैं। इसकी वजह यह होती है कि हमें अपने कानूनी अधिकारों की जानकारी नहीं होती है। ऐसे में हम TTE या आरपीएफ द्वारा बताए गई हर बात को सही मान लेते हैं और ऐसे में जैसा वे कहते हैं, हम वैसा ही करते हैं। जबकि हमारे भी कुछ कानूनी अधिकार होते हैं। आज हम जानें अपने अधिकार कॉलम में ट्रेन में यात्रा करने के दौरान अपने अधिकार के बारे में बात करेंगे और साथ ही जानेंगे कि- सवाल- अगर मैं बिना टिकट ट्रेन में यात्रा कर रहा हूं और TTE पकड़ ले तो क्या मुझे गिरफ्तार किया जा सकता है? जवाब- नहीं, TTE आपको सीधे गिरफ्तार नहीं कर सकता है। हालांकि, बिना टिकट यात्रा करना भारतीय रेलवे के नियमों के खिलाफ है। ऐसा करने पर जुर्माना लगाया जा सकता है। सवाल- क्या बिना टिकट यात्रा करने पर TTE मनमाना जुर्माना वसूल सकते हैं? जवाब- नहीं, TTE आपसे मनमाना जुर्माना नहीं वसूल सकते हैं। बिना टिकट यात्रा करने पर जुर्माने की राशि ट्रेन, ट्रैवल क्लास, दूरी और अन्य कारणों पर निर्भर करती है। आइए इसे ग्राफिक के जरिए समझते हैं। सवाल- अगर TTE ने प मनमाना जुर्माना लगाया, तो क्या मैं शिकायत कर सकता हूं? जवाब- हां, अगर आपको लगता है कि TTE ने जुर्माना अनुचित तरीके से लगाया है, तो आप 155210 पर मैसेज करके या 139 पर कॉल करके शिकायत कर सकते हैं। आप रेलवे के अधिकारियों से से शिकायत कर सकते हैं। सवाल- जुर्माना देने से इंकार करने पर क्या हो सकता है? जवाब- अगर आप जुर्माना देने के लिए तैयार नहीं होते हैं, तो रेलवे अधिनियम के अंतर्गत आपको अगले स्टेशन पर गाड़ी से उतारा जा सकता है। या मुकदमा भी चलाया जा सकता है। इसमें आपको एक माह की सजा या 500 रुपए का जुर्माना या दोनों हो सकते हैं। वहीं अगर कोई यात्री TTE के साथ अभद्रता करता है, उत्पात मचाता है और रेलवे के नियमों का उल्लघंन करता है, तो TTE रेलवे पुलिस को सूचित कर सकता है। इसके बाद रेलवे पुलिस (RPF) आपको गिरफ्तार कर कार्रवाई कर सकती है। जिसके बाद कोर्ट आपको रेलवे अधिनियम 139 के तहत 6 माह की सजा सुना सकती है। सवाल- अगर मुझे बिना टिकट पकड़ा जाता है, तो क्या मुझे रेलवे पुलिस के हवाले कर सकती है? जवाब- नहीं, TTE आपसे सिर्फ जुर्माने की राशि भरने के लिए कहेगा। यदि आपने जुर्माना नहीं भरा या अगर आप TTE के साथ सहयोग नहीं करते हैं, तो TTE आपको रेलवे पुलिस के हवाले कर सकता है। सवाल- क्या बिना टिकट यात्रा करने पर मुझे जेल हो सकती है? जवाब- बिना टिकट यात्रा करना एक सिविल अपराध की श्रेणी में आता है। इसमें आमतौर पर जुर्माना वसूला जाता है। अगर आप जुर्माना भर देते हैं, तो आपको जेल नहीं होगी। सवाल- अगर मैं यात्रा के दौरान बिना टिकट पकड़ लिया जाता हूं, तो क्या मुझे ट्रेन से उतारा जा सकता है? जवाब- आमतौर पर ऐसा नहीं किया जाता है। हालांकि, कुछ परिस्थितियों में ऐसा हो सकता है। आइए इसे ग्राफिक के जरिए समझते हैं। सवाल- बिना टिकट यात्रा करने के बाद अगर जुर्माना नहीं भरता हूं, तो TTE क्या कदम उठा सकता है? जवाब- अगर आपने जुर्माना नहीं भरा, तो TTE आपके खिलाफ एक कानूनी प्रक्रिया शुरू कर सकता है। वह आपको रेलवे पुलिस के पास भेज सकता है। रेलवे पुलिस उस स्थिति का मूल्यांकन करेगी और अगर मामला हल नहीं होता है, तो आपको रेलवे कोर्ट में पेश किया जा सकता है। रेलवे कोर्ट में आपको सुनवाई का अवसर मिलेगा वहां, आप अपनी बात रख सकते हैं। इसके बाद कोर्ट फैसला करेगी। फैसले के आधार पर जुर्माना या सजा हो सकती है। सवाल- क्या बिना टिकट यात्रा करना सिविल अपराध है या आपराधिक अपराध? जवाब- बिना टिकट यात्रा एक सिविल अपराध है, न कि आपराधिक अपराध। इसका मतलब है कि इसके लिए आपको जुर्माना भरना पड़ सकता है। मामला अदालत में सुलझाया जा सकता है। हालांकि, अगर आप यात्रा के दौरान कानून तोड़ते हैं, जैसे कि पुलिस से मारपीट करना या कोर्ट का आदेश न मानना, तो यह आपराधिक अपराध बन सकता है, जिसके लिए सजा और जेल हो सकती है। सवाल- क्या बिना टिकट यात्रा के मामले में वकील की मदद की आवश्यकता हो सकती है? जवाब- बिना टिकट यात्रा के सामान्य मामलों में वकील की मदद की आवश्यकता नहीं होती, क्योंकि यह एक सिविल मामला है। लेकिन अगर मामला अदालत में पहुंच जाता है और आपको लगता है कि जुर्माना अनुचित है या आपको अन्य कानूनी मदद की जरूरत है, तो आप वकील की मदद ले सकते हैं। वकील आपके अधिकारों की रक्षा करेगा और आपको कानूनी प्रक्रियाओं को समझाने में मदद करेगा।'जानें अपने अधिकार' से जुड़ी ये खबर भी पढ़ेंजानें अपने अधिकार- ITR न भरने पर क्या होगा:जानें कौन से नोटिस का क्या अर्थ, जानें कैसे जुर्माने से बचें इनकम टैक्स एक्ट, 1961 के सेक्शन 139 के मुताबिक, भारत में अगर आपकी आय टैक्स के दायरे में आती है तो इनकम टैक्स रिटर्न (ITR) फाइल करना जरूरी है। कई बार लोग इसे समय पर फाइल नहीं कर पाते या फाइल करते समय कुछ छोटी-मोटी गलतियां कर बैठते हैं। इससे रिफंड रुक जाता है और कभी-कभी इनकम टैक्स डिपार्टमेंट से नोटिस भी आ जाता है। पूरी खबर पढ़िए...",

            "description": "IPL 2025 MI vs RR: कर्ण शर्मा और ट्रेंट बोल्ट की शानदार गेंदबाजी के दम पर मुंबई इंडियंस (एमआई) ने आईपीएल 2025 में अपनी लगातार छठी जीत दर्ज की और सवाई मानसिंह स्टेडियम में राजस्थान रॉयल्स (आरआर) को 100 रनों के विशाल अंतर से हराकर अंक तालिका में शीर्ष स्थान हासिल कर लिया.मुंबई ने पहले बल्लेबाजी करते हुए 217/2 का विशाल स्कोर खड़ा किया, जिसमें रयान रिकेल्टन और रोहित शर्मा की अर्धशतकीय पारियों के साथ-साथ सूर्यकुमार यादव और कप्तान हार्दिक पांड्या के नाबाद 48-48 रनों का योगदान रहा. इसके बाद एमआई की गेंदबाजी ने आरआर को 16.1 ओवर में मात्र 117 रनों पर समेट दिया, जिससे जयपुर में उनकी 2012 के बाद पहली जीत दर्ज हुई.मुंबई की इस शानदार जीत ने उनकी नेट रन रेट को 1.274 तक पहुंचा दिया, जो टूर्नामेंट में सर्वश्रेष्ठ है. दूसरी ओर, इस करारी हार ने राजस्थान रॉयल्स को आईपीएल 2025 से बाहर कर दिया. 217 रनों के विशाल लक्ष्य का बचाव करने उतरी एमआई ने शुरू से ही आरआर पर दबाव बनाए रखा. दीपक चाहर ने युवा वैभव सूर्यवंशी को, जिन्होंने पिछले मैच में 35 गेंदों में शतक जड़ा था, दो गेंदों में शून्य पर मिड-ऑन पर कैच आउट कराया. यशस्वी जायसवाल ने ट्रेंट बोल्ट के खिलाफ दो छक्के जड़े, लेकिन बोल्ट ने उसी ओवर में उनकी गिल्लियां बिखेर दीं.नितीश राणा अगले शिकार बने, जिन्होंने बोल्ट की गेंद पर डीप स्क्वायर लेग को कैच थमाया. रियान पराग को लगातार शॉर्ट गेंदों से परेशान किया गया और आखिरकार उन्होंने जसप्रीत बुमराह की गेंद पर मिड-विकेट को टॉप-एज दे दिया. बुमराह ने अगली ही गेंद पर शिमरन हेटमायर को भी मिड-विकेट पर कैच आउट कराया. पावरप्ले में आरआर 62/5 पर सिमट गई। शुभम दुबे ने नौ गेंदों में 15 रन बनाकर कुछ प्रतिरोध दिखाया, लेकिन हार्दिक पांड्या ने उन्हें लॉन्ग-ऑन पर कैच आउट करा दिया. ध्रुव जुरेल ने कर्ण शर्मा की गेंद पर पैडल स्वीप की कोशिश की, लेकिन ग्लव्स से लगकर गेंद कर्ण के हाथों में चली गई, जो इम्पैक्ट प्लेयर के रूप में आए थे.कर्ण ने 12वें ओवर में दो विकेट लेकर आरआर की कमर तोड़ दी, जबकि बोल्ट ने जोफ्रा आर्चर (30) को शॉर्ट फाइन लेग पर कैच आउट कराकर पारी का अंत किया। इस जीत ने एमआई की स्थिति को और मजबूत कर दिया.संक्षिप्त स्कोर: मुंबई इंडियंस 217/2 (रयान रिकेल्टन 61, रोहित शर्मा 53; रियान पराग 1-12) ने राजस्थान रॉयल्स 117 (जोफ्रा आर्चर 30, रियान पराग 16; कर्ण शर्मा 3-23, ट्रेंट बोल्ट 3-28) को 100 रनों से हराया.",

इंटरनेट से डाउनलोड करना और NFT खरीदने में बड़ा अंतर यह है कि NFT में आपके पास उस डिजिटल प्रॉपर्टी का स्वामित्व आ जाता है। आप जब चाहें उसे किसी दूसरे को बेच सकते हैं। जबकि डाउनलोड की गई कॉपी आप किसी को बेचकर पैसा नहीं कमा सकते, न ही किसी को गिफ्ट कर सकते हैं, जबकि NFT किसी दूसरे को गिफ्ट की जा सकती है। यह ब्लॉकचेन टेक्नोलॉजी है। इसमें यदि आपने प्रॉपर्टी की केवल 100 कॉपी क्रिएट की हैं, तो पूरी दुनिया में केवल 100 कॉपी रहेंगी। इसके कारण NFT मूल्यवान हो जाती है। लोगों को दुर्लभ चीज खरीदना पसंद है और इसके लिए वे कोई भी कीमत देने को तैयार हो जाते हैं। अब यह समझते हैं कि आप क्या कर सकते हैं। एनएफटी मिंटिंग सेंटर खोल सकते हैं। यहां आप अपने क्षेत्र के सभी प्रकार के कलाकारों के लिए काम करेंगे। किसी ने कविता लिखी है, किसी ने कविता अपनी आवाज में सुनाई है, किसी ने गीत लिखा है, कोई अच्छा ग्राफिक डिजाइनर है, कोई दुर्लभ कहानी है, किसी के पास कोई दुर्लभ फोटो या वीडियो है - किसी भी प्रकार की दुर्लभ चीज जिसे इंटरनेट पर अपलोड किया जा सकता है। आप उनके आर्ट को NFT करेंगे। इसे मिंटिंग (Minting) कहते हैं। और फिर एनएफटी मार्केटप्लेस पर जाकर उसे लिस्ट कर देंगे। दुनिया भर में कोई भी व्यक्ति आपके द्वारा लिस्ट की गई डिजिटल प्रॉपर्टी को खरीदेगा, तो आपको पैसा मिलेगा। आप अपना कमीशन रखकर बाकी पैसा संबंधित कलाकार को दे देंगे। यह बिल्कुल प्रॉपर्टी डीलर जैसा काम है। प्रॉपर्टी डीलर फिजिकल प्रॉपर्टीज को बेचने का काम करता है, आप डिजिटल प्रॉपर्टीज को बेचने का काम करेंगे। प्रॉपर्टी डीलर की लिमिटेशन होती है, लेकिन आपकी कोई लिमिटेशन नहीं है। सारी दुनिया में कहीं भी और कोई भी आपके द्वारा लिस्ट की गई डिजिटल प्रॉपर्टी को खरीद सकता है। इसके अलावा, एनएफटी की ट्रेडिंग कर सकते हैं। इसके लिए आपको मार्केट पर निरंतर नजर रखनी है। जैसे ही आपको कोई दुर्लभ डिजिटल प्रॉपर्टी दिखाई देती है, आप उसे खरीदकर अपने पास रख सकते हैं और जब उसकी कीमत बढ़ जाए, तो उसे बेच सकते हैं। इस प्रकार आप थोड़ा पैसा इन्वेस्टमेंट करके काफी मोटी कमाई कर सकते हैं। इसके अलावा और भी बहुत सारे रास्ते हैं। NFT Games खेलकर पैसा कमा सकते हैं। NFT Designer या Developer बनकर पैसा कमा सकते हैं। कुल मिलाकर एनएफटी का मार्केट साइज लगातार बढ़ता चला जा रहा है। 2023 में लगभग 36 बिलियन डॉलर का कारोबार हुआ था और 2024 में लगभग 49 बिलियन डॉलर का कारोबार हुआ। 2030 तक इसके कई सौ अरब डॉलर तक पहुंच जाने की उम्मीद है। क्योंकि अमेरिका और इसके जैसे दूसरे देशों में लोग अब किसी भी दुर्लभ डिजिटल प्रॉपर्टी को पैसा देकर जिंदगी भर के लिए अपने पास डाउनलोड करके रखना पसंद नहीं कर रहे हैं। वे एनएफटी खरीदना पसंद कर रहे हैं ताकि समय आने पर उसे किसी दूसरे व्यक्ति को बेचकर पैसा कमाया जा सके। दुर्लभ वस्तुओं के ऑफलाइन बाजार की तरह यह दुर्लभ चीजों का ऑनलाइन मार्केट प्लेस हो गया है।best new unique business ideas in hindi for students कॉलेज के विद्यार्थी और प्रतियोगी परीक्षाओं के अभ्यर्थी इस बिजनेस में सबसे ज्यादा पैसा कमा सकते हैं, क्योंकि ब्लॉकचेन टेक्नोलॉजी और एनएफटी की मिंटिंग आप बड़ी आसानी से सीख सकते हैं। अपनी पढ़ाई के दौरान मिंटिंग सीख लीजिए और ट्रायल शुरू कर दीजिए। आपके द्वारा अपलोड की गई दुर्लभ डिजिटल प्रॉपर्टी की बिक्री हो या न हो, लेकिन आप मार्केट सीख जाएंगे। जब तक आपकी परीक्षा का रिजल्ट आएगा, तब तक आप मिंटिंग के स्पेशलिस्ट बन चुके होंगे। आपको न तो किसी सरकारी नौकरी की लाइन में लगना पड़ेगा और न ही किसी मल्टीनेशनल कंपनी में जॉब पाने के लिए परेशान होना पड़ेगा।Business ideas for women in india भारत की लड़कियां और महिलाएं, यहां तक कि हाउसवाइफ भी इस बिजनेस से बहुत अच्छा पैसा कमा सकती हैं। बस थोड़ा सा सीखने की जरूरत है। ट्यूटोरियल इंटरनेट पर पहले से मौजूद हैं। एक बार आपने सीख लिया, तो आपका मुकाबला कोई नहीं कर पाएगा, क्योंकि आप तो मेहंदी के दुर्लभ डिजाइन भी एनएफटी करके बेच सकती हैं। यह काम दुनिया भर में किसी और को नहीं आता।Business ideas for retired employees in india सेवानिवृत्त शासकीय कर्मचारी इस बिजनेस में इन्वेस्टमेंट करके धमाकेदार रिटर्न कमा सकते हैं। आपको सिर्फ एक काम करना है - ऐसे युवाओं की टीम बनानी है, जिन्हें एनएफटी आती है। वे क्रिएट कर सकते हैं या फिर ट्रेडिंग कर सकते हैं। कोई भी चीज कितनी दुर्लभ हो सकती है, इसका मूल्यांकन आपसे अच्छा कोई नहीं कर सकता। उम्र और अनुभव इस मामले में आपको सबसे सफल बनाता है।Profitable business ideas in india जहां तक इन्वेस्टमेंट की बात है, तो केवल एक कंप्यूटर या लैपटॉप चाहिए, जो वैसे भी आपके पास होगा। प्रॉफिट की बात करें, तो डीलरशिप करने पर कमीशन मिलेगा और ट्रेडिंग करने पर प्रॉफिट कमा सकते हैं। दोनों ही स्थिति में आपको जितनी भी कमाई होगी, उसका 90% आपका नेट प्रॉफिट रहेगा। यानी यदि एक बिजनेसमैन ने साल भर में 50 लाख का बिजनेस किया और 35 लाख रुपये खर्च हो गए, तो उसका नेट प्रॉफिट केवल 15 लाख होगा। जबकि आपने यदि 50 लाख का बिजनेस किया, तो आपका नेट प्रॉफिट 45 लाख रुपये होगा, क्योंकि आपके बिजनेस में नाममात्र का पैसा खर्च होता है। Notice: this is the copyright protected post. do not try to copy of this article. विनम्र अनुरोध कृपया हमें गूगल न्यूज़ पर फॉलो करें। सबसे तेज अपडेट प्राप्त करने के लिए टेलीग्राम चैनल सब्सक्राइब करें एवं हमारे व्हाट्सएप कम्युनिटी ज्वॉइन करें। व्हाट्सएप ग्रुप ज्वाइन करने के लिए यहां क्लिक करें कृपया गूगल न्यूज़ पर फॉलो करें यहां क्लिक करें टेलीग्राम चैनल सब्सक्राइब करने के लिए यहां क्लिक करें X-ट्विटर पर फॉलो करने के लिए यहां क्लिक करें इसके अलावा और अधिक बिजनेस आईडियाज के लिए कृपया स्क्रॉल करके सबसे नीचे जाएं और POPULAR Category 3 में Business पर क्लिक करें।",

This extreme weather event led to the closure of schools and offices and caused significant flight disruptions.In the Canterbury region, heavy rainfall resulted in floods and landslides, prompting evacuations. Despite the lifting of some warnings, both Christchurch City and Selwyn District continue to battle surface flooding and road closures. The Selwyn District Council reassured residents via Facebook that the worst was behind them.Wellington International Airport has reopened, although not all flights have managed to land safely, as reported by local news outlet Stuff. Images circulating on news sites depict rocks and debris scattered along roads on Wellington's south coast, with waves continuing to breach sea walls.

            "description": "Jammu Kashmir Terror Attack: आदिवासी कल्याण के लिए काम करने वाले गैर सरकारी संगठन हाईरेंज रूरल डेवलपमेंट सोसायटी (एचआरडीएस) इंडिया ने (1 मई, 2025) को उद्योगपति रॉबर्ट वाड्रा के खिलाफ दिल्ली के लोदी कॉलोनी थाने में एक औपचारिक शिकायत दर्ज कराई है. एचआरडीएस इंडिया के सचिव अजी कृष्णन ने शिकायत में आरोप लगाया है कि वाड्रा ने जम्मू-कश्मीर के पहलगाम में 22 अप्रैल को हुए आतंकवादी हमले को कथित तौर पर जायज ठहराने वाला बयान दिया है, जो राष्ट्रविरोधी मानसिकता को दर्शाता है.अजी कृष्णन ने कहा कि यह निर्मम आतंकवादी हमला पूरे देश को झकझोर कर रख देने वाला था. वैश्विक स्तर पर भी इसकी कड़ी निंदा की गई है. उन्होंने अपनी शिकायत में कहा कि रॉबर्ट वाड्रा ने यह संकेत दिया कि यह हमला मुस्लिम समुदाय में कथित असुरक्षा की भावना के चलते हुआ है. शिकायत के अनुसार वाड्रा ने कहा कि यह हमला प्रधानमंत्री के लिए एक संदेश था, जिससे यह प्रतीत होता है कि उन्होंने आतंकवाद को देश की आंतरिक परिस्थितियों की प्रतिक्रिया के रूप में दर्शाया.'वाड्रा का बयान आम नागरिकों की हत्या को जायज ठहरा रहा'एचआरडीएस इंडिया ने इस कथन को अत्यंत भड़काऊ और खतरनाक बताया है. शिकायत में यह भी कहा गया है कि वाड्रा का बयान आम नागरिकों की हत्या को जायज ठहरा रहा है और आतंकवाद को देश की नीतियों पर प्रतिक्रिया के रूप में दर्शाता है. उन्होंने (वाड्रा ने) कहा था, 'यह सरकार सिर्फ हिंदुत्व की बात करती है. यह मस्जिदों का सर्वे कराती है और धार्मिक मामलों में हस्तक्षेप करती है. हमलावरों ने लोगों को उनके धर्म के आधार पर निशाना बनाया. इसकी वजह है कि इस देश में हिंदू और मुस्लिमों के बीच फासला बढ़ा है. धर्म के आधार पर लोगों की हत्या करना प्रधानमंत्री को दिया गया संदेश है. ऐसा इसलिए हुआ क्योंकि मुसलमान इस देश में असुरक्षित महसूस करते हैं.' एचआरडीएस इंडिया का मानना है कि इस प्रकार की टिप्पणियां न सिर्फ आतंकवाद को परोक्ष समर्थन देती हैं, बल्कि समाज में भय और सांप्रदायिक तनाव को भी जन्म देती हैं. वाड्रा ने कथित रूप से यह भी कहा कि भारत अब धर्मनिरपेक्ष राष्ट्र नहीं रहा और यहां धार्मिक राजनीति हावी हो गई है. उन्होंने मस्जिदों में नमाज पर रोक, लाउडस्पीकर पर पाबंदी और दिल्ली की जामा मस्जिद के आस-पास जुटने पर कार्रवाई का जिक्र किया.'रॉबर्ट वाड्रा पर कठोर कानूनी कार्रवाई की मांग' एचआरडीएस इंडिया ने इस कथानक की कड़ी निंदा करते हुए इसे शांति-व्यवस्था को अस्थिर करने वाला, हिंसा को बढ़ावा देने वाला और समाज को बांटने वाला प्रयास बताया है. संस्था का कहना है कि जब देश एक भयानक हमले के पीड़ितों को न्याय दिलाने की मांग कर रहा है, ऐसे में इस तरह के बयान देश के दुश्मनों को बल देने वाले हैं.संस्था ने भारतीय न्याय संहिता 2023 के प्रासंगिक प्रावधानों के तहत रॉबर्ट वाड्रा पर कठोर कानूनी कार्रवाई की मांग की है, ताकि आतंकवाद को जायज ठहराने और सांप्रदायिक वैमनस्य फैलाने जैसे गंभीर कृत्यों पर अंकुश लगाया जा सके.ये भी पढ़ें:बांग्लादेश में बढ़ रही कट्टरपंथियों की एक्टिविटी, बॉर्डर पर बढ़ी सुरक्षा बलों की तैनाती, जानें BSF ने क्यों जताई चिंता",

            "description": "बक्सर का भेलूपुर गांव इन दिनों चर्चा में है। यहां की बेटी कमला बिसेसर को हाल ही में त्रिनिदाद एंड टोबैगो में हुए संसदीय चुनाव में जीत मिली है। वे पहले भी त्रिनिदाद एंड टोबैगो की प्रधानमंत्री रह चुकी हैं। अब एक बार फिर से वे प्रधानमंत्री बनने की दौड़ में शामिल हैं। कमला बिसेसर जब 13 साल पहले भारत आई थीं, तो अपने पूर्वजों की जड़ों को तलाशते हुए बक्सर जिले के भेलूपुर गांव पहुंची थीं। उस समय वे त्रिनिदाद एंड टोबैगो की प्रधानमंत्री थीं। उनके पहुंचने पर उनके साथ ही गांव में पहली बार पक्की सड़क भी आई थी, लेकिन जैसे ही वो लौटीं, सड़क के पांव भी उखड़ गईं। जब कमला आईं थीं, तब गांव में पीने के शुद्ध पानी के लिए वाटर प्लांट भी लगाया गया था। लेकिन उनके लौटते ही जैसे प्रशासन की नजर हट गई और प्लांट के साथ-साथ विकास की उम्मीदें भी टूट गईं। दैनिक भास्कर की टीम आज कमला बिसेसर के गांव में पहुंची और उनके रिश्तेदारों के साथ-साथ गांव के लोगों से बातचीत की। कमला के दोबारा पीएम बनने की संभावना पर गांव में खुशी गांव के लोगों ने बातचीत में बताया कि कमला एक बार फिर से प्रधानमंत्री बनने की रेस में शामिल हैं। ऐसे में गांव के लोगों में खुशी है। गांव के संतोष यादव, सुरेंद्र यादव, उमेश यादव और मुन्ना मिश्रा समेत कई लोगों ने बताया कि उस ऐतिहासिक यात्रा के समय प्रशासन ने 10 सूत्री मांग पत्र पर विकास कार्यों का आश्वासन दिया था, लेकिन 13 साल बीत गए, कोई भी मांग पूरी नहीं हुई। कमला बिसेसर के आगमन के बाद गांव को शुद्ध पेयजल प्लांट मिला, सड़क बनी, लेकिन आज वो प्लांट जर्जर हो गया है, सड़कें टूटी हैं और लोग अब भी खारे पानी व गंदगी के बीच जीने को मजबूर हैं। ग्रामीण ने कहा कि गांव की विकास की बात यहां के प्रशासन पर निर्भर करता है। कहा कि 136 साल पहले हमारे पूर्वज गिरमिटिया मजदूर थे। आज भी गांव की पहचान मजदूर के रूप में ही है। आसपास के क्षेत्रों को किसी कार्य के लिए मजदूर की आवश्यकता होती है तो इस गांव में आते हैं। ये गांव मजदूरों का था है और लगता है कि आगे भी लगता है कि मजदूरों का गांव बनकर ही रहेगा। कहा- डीएम को 10 सूत्री मांगपत्र दिया था गांव के उमेश यादव ने कहा कि गांव के विकास के लिए उस समय के डीएम को 10 सूत्री मांग पत्र दिया गया था, जिनकी ओर से ग्रामीणों से उसको पूरा करने की घोषणा भी की गई। लेकिन 13 साल बाद भी पूरा नहीं हुआ।ग्रामीणों ने बताया की मांग किया गया था कि गांव शुद्ध पानी के लिए एक बड़ा टंकी लगाया जाए। गांव में स्कूल कॉलेज खोला जाए, एक छोटे अस्पताल की व्यवस्था हो, गांव के लिंक रोड पर एक कमला प्रसाद के नाम का गेट बनाया जाए। गांव के संतोष यादव बताते हैं कि पहली बार एक छोटे से गांव की बिटिया उत्तरी अमेरिका त्रिनिदाद एंड टोबैगो की पीएम बनने की जानकारी पर गांव के लोगों में खुशहाली छा गई थी। साथ ही ये भी सूचना मिली कि साढ़े 14 हजार किलोमीटर दूर से अपने पूर्वज के गांव आ रही जिससे खुशी दोगुना हो गया। जब वे आई थीं, तब गांव की सूरत और सीरत दोनों बदल गई थी। अब प्रशासन गांव की सुध नही ले रहा।",

            "description": "India’s creative wave is going global — and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is all in. At WAVES 2025 — the inaugural World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit in Mumbai — the Prime Minister delivered a passionate pitch to India’s creators. From Guwahati’s musicians to Kochi’s podcasters, from Bengaluru’s game designers to Punjab’s filmmakers, Modi said a new \"wave of creativity\" is powering India's economic and cultural rise. He called it the Orange Economy — a global term for the creative sector — spanning film, TV, design, gaming, software, fashion, cultural tourism, and digital content. With $30 billion in GDP contribution, 8% of India’s workforce, and $11 billion+ in creative exports, this is more than art — it’s economics. Modi emphasised how even the smallest screen has become a \"micro screen with a mega message\", transforming creators into global influencers. India’s creative economy is no longer niche — it’s a strategic growth engine. From reels to revenue, from YouTube stars to indie coders — the future is creative, and it’s Made in India.",

            "description": "कामयाब कोटा एवं कोटा केयर्स अभियान के तहत जिला कलक्टर डॉ.रविन्द्र गोस्वामी कोचिंग कैम्पस में स्टूडेंट्स की क्लास में पहुंचे और उनसे संवाद किया। उन्होंने स्टूडेंट्स को स्वयं के अनुभवों से लाइफ स्किल्स के बारे में बताते हुए खुश रहते हुए तैयारी करने के मंत्र बताए। डॉ.रविन्द्र गोस्वामी ने कहा कि गलतियां सभी से होती है। हममें से कोई भी ऐसा नहीं है जो बिना गिरे चलना सीख गया हो। गलतियां होना स्वभाविक है, हमें उन्हें स्वीकारना आना चाहिए। गलतियों को स्वीकारों और उनसे सीखते हुए सुधार करो, तभी सफलता मिलेगी। उन्होंने कहा कि आपके गिरने पर दुनिया कमेंट दे सकती है, उससे मतलब नहीं रखें। दुनिया पत्थर फेंकती तो फेंकने दो आप उन पत्थरों को एकत्रित करके घर बना लो, यही जीत है। आलोचनाओं से भी सीखो, खामोश रहकर अपनी सफलता प्राप्त करके जवाब देना सीखो। कोटा यही सिखाता है, कोटा में आप सिर्फ मेडिकल या इंजीनियरिंग प्रवेश परीक्षा की तैयारी करने नहीं आए, यहां आकर लाइफ स्किल्स सीखना है, मजबूत होकर संघर्ष करते हुए आगे बढ़ना सीखना है। डॉ.गोस्वामी ने कहा कि हमें पढ़ने के तरीके के बारे में सोचना चाहिए। हम स्मार्टली रिवीजन करें। की-वर्ड्स बनाएं। कापी के जिन पेज पर डिफिकल्टीज है, उनके की-वर्ड बनाकर उसी पेज के कोने पर लिख दें। इसके बाद जब आप रिवीजन करेंगे तो की-वर्ड देखते ही आपका रिवीजन हो जाएगा। इसके अलावा जब कभी रूटीन काम से छुट्टी मिल जाए, क्लास नहीं हो तो रिवीजन पर ध्यान देना चाहिए। एक छात्रा के ओवर थिंकिंग और सेल्फ डाउट से जुड़े सवाल पर उन्होंने कहा कि ये दोनों समस्याएं हर व्यक्ति के साथ है। सेल्फ डाउट दिमाग का मैकेनिज्म है जो हमें अवेयर रखता है। हम जिस चीज को इंर्पोटेंस देते हैं दिमाग उसको बार-बार क्रॉस चैक करता है। यह अच्छा है लेकिन ज्यादा नहीं हो। जब हम बातों को जनरलाइज कर लेते हैं तो ओवर थिंकिंग में नहीं जाते। ओवर थिंकिंग भी होती है और सेल्फ डाउट भी होते हैं। दोनों के लिए हमें ठहरकर सोचने की जरूरत होती है। मेरा मानना है कि जो भी विषय है उसके बारे में सोचें और स्वीकारें कि मैं इस विषय पर ज्यादा सोच रहा हूं और फिर उसके लिए विकल्प लिख लें। जैसे यदि आप यह सोच रहे हैं कि आज खाना नहीं मिला तो इसे लिखें और इससे होने वाले असर को लिखें और फिर उसे फाड़ दें, कागज-पेन नहीं है तो खुद को वाट्सअप कर लें और फिर डिलिट कर दें। आप देखेंगे कि ओवर थिंकिंग और सेल्फ डाउट से आप बहुत हद तक उबर जाएंगे। डॉ.गोस्वामी ने कहा कि स्टूडेंट्स को अपना अटेंशन स्पान समझना चाहिए। इसके अनुसार ही प्लानिंग करनी चाहिए। हम कितनी देर पढ़ सकते हैं। यह समझते हुए ही छोटी-छोटी प्लानिंग करें। ऐसे में एक्जीक्यूशन अच्छा हो सकेगा। आउटपुट ज्यादा आएगा। कई बार हम प्लानिंग लम्बी कर लेते हैं और एक्जीक्यूशन हमारे अटेंशन स्पान से ज्यादा लम्बा हो जाता है। इससे मामला बिगड़ जाता है। छोटे स्पेल में प्लानिंग करें, छोटे स्पेल में ही एक्जीक्यूशन करें और स्वयं को छोटे-छोटे रिवॉर्ड दें। मोबाइल हमारा शत्रु है। जब पढ़ाई करते हैं तो ध्यान में आता है कि कोई रील मिस तो नहीं हो गई, जब रील देख रहे होते हैं तो पछतावा होता है कि पढ़ाई करते तो अच्छा रहता। इस अपराधबोध से बचने के लिए हमें दोनों का समय निर्धारित करना चाहिए। जब पढ़ाई करें तो सिर्फ पढ़ाई में ही ध्यान हो और जब रील देखेंगे तो पूरे ध्यान से ही देखेंगे।",

            "description": "ED to Prioritize FEMA Compliance in 2025 Amid Rising PMLA Actions The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is set to turn its attention toward violations under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) in 2025, according to a recent announcement by the agency's Director, Rahul Navin. Addressing the audience on the agency's foundation day, Navin emphasized that FEMA violations will be the primary focus this year.Director Navin underscored the ED's role in enforcing FEMA to ensure adherence to rules established by the Central Government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). These regulations oversee cross-border financial activities, and Navin affirmed that the agency would conduct investigations, adjudications, and impose penalties where necessary to uphold these standards.Highlighted violations include export-import fraud, foreign direct investment (FDI) regulation breaches, external borrowing misuse, land ownership infractions by non-residents, and unauthorized overseas fund transfers. Navin also mentioned encouraging defaulters to use the compounding of offenses route when appropriate, aiming for corrective measures rather than solely punitive actions to boost financial discipline.In parallel, the ED has significantly ramped up its enforcement activities under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) from 2014 to 2024, registering over 5,113 cases and issuing provisional attachment orders worth Rs 30,036 crore. The Director expressed satisfaction with the increased enforcement activities and highlighted continued rigorous action against money laundering, with substantial increases in both the number and value of provisional attachments.As of March 31, 2025, assets under provisional attachment have reached Rs 1,54,594 crore. The ED is focusing on unlocking these assets' economic potential and compensating victims via Non Conviction Based Confiscation and Restitution provisions, with Rs 15,261 crore restitution completed in 30 cases this financial year, with court approvals.",

            "description": "Sanjay Leela Bhansali, known for his distinctive visual style and storytelling, brought his signature grandeur to the digital space with Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar. Released a year ago, the series marked his digital debut and went on to become a global success, praised for its rich production design and compelling narrative. Blending Indian cultural themes with universal storytelling, Heeramandi struck a chord with audiences worldwide. As the series marks its first anniversary, it’s a fitting moment to look back at its impact and achievements.Talking about Heeramandi Sanjay Leela Bhansali said, “I’ve always wanted to lose myself in my art, and Heeramandi gave me that. It’s the biggest set I’ve ever created, and it pushed the boundaries I once thought were unmovable. As a child, I imagined limits, but today, I find myself building worlds far beyond them. With each project, I’ve come to enjoy the process even more—not to dictate, but to create. To place the walls further and further, and then let the story breathe within them.”Premiered on May 1, Heeramandi shattered records, becoming the most-watched Indian web series in its first week and the second most-watched non-Indian web series globally in the first week of its release. The series garnered an impressive 4.5 million views and accumulated a staggering 33 million viewership hours within just seven days.

Ranking second on Netflix’s Non-English TV List, Heeramandi solidified its universal appeal, showcasing the power of Indian storytelling and its resonance across diverse audiences worldwide.Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar brought together a stellar ensemble cast including Manisha Koirala, Sonakshi Sinha, Aditi Rao Hydari, Richa Chadha, Sharmin Segal, Sanjeeda Shaikh, Fardeen Khan, Taha Shah Badussha, Shekhar Suman, and Adhyayan Suman. Each delivered layered performances that contributed to the series’ critical acclaim. Set in Lahore’s Heera Mandi during the pre-independence era, the story unfolds against the backdrop of the freedom movement, exploring themes of love, sacrifice, power, and resistance with visual richness and emotional depth.With his signature visual style and meticulous direction, Sanjay Leela Bhansali delivered a series that resonated both critically and culturally. Heeramandi marked a milestone in Indian OTT storytelling, expanding its reach to global audiences.

Asif.On the work front next Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Love & War is poised to be one of the most anticipated films upon its release.Also Read : 1 year of Heeramandi: When Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s web series debut received global acclaim, watch exclusive pictures",
