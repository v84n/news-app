            "description": "Lucknow Super Giants head coach Justin Langer received a reporter's mother’s call during the press conference after his side’s 12-run win over Mumbai Indians at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow on Friday, April 4. Lucknow Super Giants registered their second win of the season and first win at home against Mumbai Indians. After posting a total of 203/8 in 20 overs, thanks to fifties by Mitchell Marsh (60) and Aiden Markram (53), LSG bowlers restricted MI to 191/5 overs despite a half-century by Suryakumar Yadav (67 off 43 balls). Shardul Thakur, Avesh Khan, Akash Deep, and Digvesh Singh Rathi played crucial roles in the LSG’s victory. In the last three overs of the Mumbai Indians’ 204-run chase, Avesh, Digvesh, and Shardul held their nerves as they combined conceded just 27 runs when the visitors required 40 runs off 18 balls to win the match. Justin Langer was a happy man as the Lucknow Super Giants managed to pull off a thrilling victory in front of their home crowd after losing their previous match against Punjab Kings.

However, during the press meet, the LSG coach happened to receive a phone call from the reporter's mother. The reporter kept his mobile phone on the table to record Justin Langer’s press conference. The former Australia batter and head coach hilariously picked up the reporter’s call. “Who is Ma? Who's Mum's ringing? Do you want me to answer? Hello. Mama, it's 12:08. I'm at a press conference.\" Langer said.

The Rishabh Pant-led side registered their second defeat of the season following an 8-wicket defeat against Punjab Kings. In the match against Mumbai Indians, Lucknow Super Giants turned their tables around as they registered their first home win of the season. With two wins and as many losses, Lucknow Super Giants moved to sixth spot on the points table with four points and has a NRR of -0.048 in four matches. Justin Langer credits NCA for getting Avesh Khan and Akash Deep fit in time LSG head coach Justin Langer lauded the efforts of the staff at National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru for getting their fast bowlers, Avesh Khan and Akash Deep fit in time for the season. “NCA, to their credit, have obviously done a very good job because they've got Avesh Khan back for us, they've got our Akash Deep back for us.” Langer said. “So we really appreciate the work they're doing to get the boys back playing and now hopefully Mayank as well,\" he added. Avesh Khan and Akash Deep missed the first few matches of the Lucknow Super Giants as they were recovering from respective injuries. Mayank Yadav is set to make his return soon and might feature in the second half of the ongoing IPL 2025.

            "description": "हिमाचल सरकार की आज कैबिनेट मीटिंग होने जा रही है। दिल्ली से लौटने के बाद मुख्यमंत्री सुखविंदर सिंह सुक्खू सचिवालय में मीटिंग लेंगे। इसमें बसों का किराया बढ़ाने के अलावा दूसरे महत्वपूर्ण फैसले हो सकते हैं। प्रदेश के प्राइवेट बस ऑपरेटर के साथ एचआरटीसी ने भी बस किराया बढ़ाने का सरकार को प्रस्ताव भेज रखा है। ऐसे में किराया बढ़ौतरी करनी है या नहीं। इस पर कैबिनेट में आज फैसला हो सकता है। हालांकि देश में सबसे ज्यादा बस किराया हिमाचल का ही बताया जा रहा है। स्कूल-कालेज बंद करने पर फैसला कैबिनेट में स्कूल व कालेज बंद करने पर भी फैसला हो सकता है। प्रदेश में 20 से कम स्टूडेंट एनरोलमेंट वाले सेकेंडरी स्कूल और 100 से कम छात्र संख्या वाले कालेजों को बंद किया जा सकता है। सूत्र बताते हैं कि कालेजों के मामले में सरकार छात्रों की संख्या की शर्त को 100 से घटाकर 75 भी कर सकती है। बजट घोषणाओं को मिलेगी मंजूरी कैबिनेट मीटिंग में 2025-26 के बजट भाषण में मुख्यमंत्री द्वारा की गई घोषणाओं को भी मंजूरी के लिए लाया जा सकता है, क्योंकि बजट घोषणाओं को कैबिनेट की मंजूरी अनिवार्य रहती है। करुणामूलक नौकरी को मंजूरी दे सकती है सरकार कैबिनेट में करुणामूलक नौकरी के लंबित मामलों को एकमुश्त भरने की भी मंजूरी मिल सकती है। यह मामला लंबे समय से उठता रहा है। विधानसभा बजट सत्र में भी मृतक कर्मियों के आश्रितों को नौकरी नहीं मिलने का मामला गूंजा था। लिहाजा सरकार आज करुणामूलक कोटे से लगभग 1800 पदों को एकमुश्त भरने की छूट दे सकती है।",

His journey reached its eighth day, with Ambani expressing his spiritual dedication as he prepares to bow before the revered deity, Dwarikadhish.Since commencing this spiritual walk on March 29, Ambani has trekked approximately 20 kilometres per night, preparing to conclude his journey on April 8, coinciding with the eve of his 30th birthday. Alongside his personal spiritual quest, Ambani continues to encounter and inspire acts of reverence and solidarity from fellow travellers and locals along the way.Despite the serious health challenges posed by Cushing's Syndrome, morbid obesity, asthma, and a severe lung condition, Ambani remains undeterred, chanting sacred texts such as the Hanuman Chalisa on his route. Beyond spirituality, he balances responsibilities as a key figure in Reliance Industries, overseeing major projects, and supporting religious causes.",

            "description": "Courtroom Clash: Objectionable Art Sparks Legal Debate Delhi's Patiala House Court witnessed heated exchanges on Friday over a revision petition demanding an FIR against an art gallery for displaying allegedly controversial paintings by renowned artist M F Hussain. The petitioner asserts that those responsible for showcasing the art should be aware of legal implications.Additional Sessions Judge Sumit Dass presides over the case, which challenges a magistrate court's prior dismissal of the FIR request. Proceedings have been scheduled for further arguments on April 21. Complainant Advocate Amita Sachdeva argues that Hussain's work disrespects deities by depicting them in objectionable ways.The gallery's defense maintains that the exhibition, which ran for 30 days, drew no objections apart from Sachdeva's complaint. Despite the magistrate court declining additional investigations, Judge Dass continues to explore whether legal standards of self-censorship apply within art galleries.",

            "description": "Donald Trump Remove NSA: अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप ने फिर से एक ऐसा फैसला लिया है, जिसने न केवल अमेरिका बल्कि वैश्विक राजनीति में हलचल मचा दी है. इस बार उन्होंने राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा एजेंसी (NSA) के डायरेक्टर और चार-स्‍टार जनरल टिमोथी हॉग को बर्खास्त कर दिया है. लॉरा लूमर नामक एक दक्षिणपंथी कार्यकर्ता के अनुरोध के तुरंत बाद यह कार्रवाई हुई, जिसमें उन्होंने ऐसे अधिकारियों को हटाने की मांग की थी जो ट्रंप के एजेंडे के अनुरूप नहीं हैं. यह घटना बताती है कि ट्रंप वफादारी को योग्यता से ऊपर रख रहे हैं, और सत्ता में रहते हुए वह अपने आलोचकों को किसी भी कीमत पर बर्दाश्त नहीं करेंगे.जनरल टिमोथी हॉग को साइबर और खुफिया दुनिया में 33 साल का अनुभव था. वह ट्रंप के आलोचक रहे हैं और संभवतः पूर्व जनरल मार्क मिले के करीबी माने जाते थे. उनकी बर्खास्तगी की कोई औपचारिक वजह नहीं दी गई. बल्कि इसके पीछे लॉरा लूमर जैसे बाहरी लोगों का प्रभाव दिखता है. यह बेहद चिंताजनक है कि अमेरिका की राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा जैसी संवेदनशील संस्थाओं में फैसले राजनीतिक वफादारी के आधार पर लिए जा रहे हैं. इसके अलावा, हॉग की डिप्टी, वेंडी नोबल को भी पद से हटा दिया गया. ट्रंप के करीबी यह मानते हैं कि जो अधिकारी उनकी विचारधारा के प्रति वफादार नहीं हैं, वे अमेरिका की \"महानता\" के रास्ते में रुकावट हैं.लूमर का हस्तक्षेप लॉरा लूमर, जो कि कट्टर दक्षिणपंथी मानी जाती हैं. उनका प्रभाव इस निर्णय में साफ दिखाई देता है. उन्होंने हाल ही में ट्रंप से मुलाकात कर NSA और NSS में मौजूद \"ग़ैर-वफादार\" अधिकारियों को हटाने की मांग की थी.उनका मानना है कि जनरल हॉग पूर्व प्रशासन की विचारधारा के नुमाइंदे हैं और ट्रंप के “Make America Great Again” अभियान में रुकावट हैं. ट्रंप का यह कदम इस बात का संकेत है कि वह अपने कार्यकाल में ऐसे लोगों को स्थान नहीं देंगे जिनपर वह भरोसा नहीं करते, चाहे उनकी योग्यता और अनुभव कितना भी क्यों न हो.राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा पर खतरा या केवल खर्च में कटौती? एक और महत्वपूर्ण एंगल सिग्नल-गेट विवाद से जुड़ा है. यमन में हूती हमलों से संबंधित संवेदनशील जानकारी सिग्नल ऐप पर लीक हुई थी. हालांकि जनरल हॉग का इसमें कोई प्रत्यक्ष संबंध नहीं था, फिर भी इस घटना ने NSA और NSS के अंदर विश्वास का संकट खड़ा कर दिया. इसके अलावा, यह निर्णय DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) के तहत खर्च कम करने के मकसद से सरकारी कर्मचारियों की छंटनी का हिस्सा भी हो सकता है. हालांकि, विशेषज्ञों का मानना है कि यह सिर्फ खर्च की बात नहीं, बल्कि ट्रंप की एक बड़ी राजनीतिक सफाई प्रक्रिया का हिस्सा है, जिसमें वे सिर्फ उन्हीं को प्रशासन में रखना चाहते हैं जो पूरी तरह से उनके प्रति वफादार हों.",

Though his defense has yet to suggest a sentence, prosecutors deem an 87-month term fitting for the severity of his crimes.Santos's fraudulent claims about his education and career and personal enrichment at the expense of donors, resulted in a bipartisan House expulsion. The former representative acknowledged his misconduct, expressing remorse and accountability for his actions.",

            "description": "मप्र हाई कोर्ट ने भोज मुक्त विश्वविद्यालय में 10 साल पहले हुई फैकल्टी की भर्ती को अवैध करार देते हुए रद्द करने का आदेश दिया है। कोर्ट ने विश्वविद्यालय को निर्देश दिए हैं कि वह नए सिरे से विज्ञापन जारी करे और योग्य अभ्यर्थियों को समान अवसर प्रदान करे। इस भर्ती में रीडर, असिस्टेंट प्रोफेसर और प्रोफेसर के 27 पद शामिल थे। उम्मीदवारों को नियुक्ति आदेश नहीं मिले थे, लेकिन प्रबंध बोर्ड की बैठक के मिनिट्स के आधार पर यह मामला हाई कोर्ट पहुंच गया। कोर्ट ने यह भी कहा कि राज्यपाल सचिवालय के निर्देश के बावजूद नियुक्ति प्रक्रिया को रोका नहीं गया। राज्य सरकार ने 2017 में कुलपति डॉ. तारिक जफर और प्रबंधन बोर्ड को हटाया था।",

These discussions come in the wake of China's recent military exercises around Taiwan, heightening geopolitical tensions in the region.The meeting, described as taking place under the 'special channel,' is reported by the Financial Times as the first of its kind since Trump resumed office on January 20. This diplomatic engagement signals a pivotal moment in U.S.-Taiwan relations.As the talks unfold, international observers closely watch the proceedings, given the strategic importance of Taiwan in the broader context of U.S.-China relations and regional stability.",

Russian authorities claimed the target was a gathering of Ukrainian servicemen, but Ukraine reports the missile hit a residential area instead.The attack resulted in the tragic deaths of at least 18 people, nine of whom were children. The General Staff of Ukraine's military issued a statement on Telegram highlighting the violation of international human rights norms by Russia and accused it of continuing its aggressive invasion campaign rather than seeking peace.Local officials in Kryvyi Rih have expressed outrage and deep sorrow over the incident, emphasizing the need for international intervention to address the ongoing atrocities and support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.",

These contracts, worth billions, will cover the launch of the Pentagon's most sensitive satellites over the coming years, marking a major victory for the two aerospace giants.The National Security Space Launch program is entering its third phase, assigning around 50 missions through 2029. SpaceX and ULA are among the top competitors poised to tackle the program's most challenging missions. The Space Systems Command has yet to comment on the expected announcement.The Phase 3 program's \"Lane 2\" track focuses on demanding and high-cost missions, requiring only the most seasoned launch companies to compete.

            "description": "Jerome Powell warns that Trump’s tariffs could drive inflation higher and slow economic growth. The Federal Reserve is holding off on interest rate changes until the economic impact becomes clear. Powell emphasized the need to keep inflation in check, despite Trump’s push for rate cuts. Wall Street has reacted with a selloff, and uncertainty looms. Powell reassured that while the U.S. economy remains strong, consumer concerns about rising prices are growing. The Fed is committed to monitoring inflation trends and economic stability before making its next move.",

The 2014 World Cup winner revealed his decision on Friday, marking the conclusion of a nearly 20-year career. Hummels, 36, began his journey at Bayern Munich's academy before moving to Borussia Dortmund in 2008. After multiple spells at both clubs, he joined Roma last year, where he played 18 matches for the Serie A side.With 78 caps for Germany, Hummels was a key player in their World Cup triumph in Brazil. His impressive domestic career includes five Bundesliga titles, three German Cups, and six German Super Cups. Hummels narrowly missed adding a Champions League title to his collection, as Dortmund finished as runners-up in the 2012-13 and 2023-24 seasons.In a heartfelt social media post, Hummels expressed his mixed emotions. \"After more than 18 years, I'm ending my career this summer,\" he wrote. Grateful for his journey, he acknowledged the importance of having the right mentors, teammates, and opportunities throughout his career. Hummels' contract with Roma concludes in the upcoming close season.",

            "description": "Ever since its release, Sikandar has been making waves across the nation. Garnering immense love from audiences, the film is also standing strong at the box office with its consistently rising numbers and has now reached the total collection of Rs. 158.5 Cr. worldwide. However, it has been facing paid negative reviews, with some people using reactions from Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan to misrepresent Sikandar. While this activity has been observed in various places, fans have stepped up to raise their voices against it.In the past few days, a video has been making rounds on social media, showing moviegoers—apparently after watching Sikandar—expressing their disappointment with the film. However, it was soon revealed that the video was actually an old clip of viewers reacting to Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan (2023), but it was being circulated on social media as a reaction to Sikandar. What's worse, the misleading video was even being run as an advertisement on the platform.Amidst this, Salman Khan fan clubs suspect that negative advertising is being used to influence the audience's perception of the Eid release. Admin one, who runs the Salman Khan Fan Club, said that negativity around Sikandar is being artificially inflated. “It remains to be seen whether this campaign is driven by someone in the industry, or just an aggressive push by rival fan groups. But something like this has the power to wipe off a film. It happened during Tubelight. You can't combat these posts because there is most likely an agency hired and it is multiplying bots every hour. Many posts claimed that shows are cancelled, but if you check at Gaiety Galaxy, the shows are sold out.”Another admin, who runs the fan club, Salman Army, points out how a boycott campaign had been run against Laal Singh Chaddha (2022). “We saw how online hate ensured that people stayed away from Aamir Khan's film. Something similar is happening here. Why is an old video being sold as a reaction to Sikandar?” he questions, adding that those at the helm of it are setting a “dangerous precedent”. “If an agency can be hired to run paid ads and amplify negative tweets about a film, it can be used against any actor or filmmaker in the future. It's manipulation,” he said.The massive smear campaign is being run by spending money which says that Sikandar shows are pulled down.Salman Khan returns to the big screen, joined by the stunning Rashmika Mandanna in Sikandar. Backed by the visionary Sajid Nadiadwala and directed by the master storyteller A.R. Murugadoss, the film is running successfully in theatres near you.Also Read: Ameesha Patel reacts to Salman Khan and Rashmika Mandanna’s age gap controversy; says, “Jab jodi chalti hai to chalti hai”",

He took all the kids to the mall and personally purchased everything. That day, I truly realized how generous and kind he is—giving comes naturally to him.” The gesture left a lasting impression on her, revealing a side of Salman beyond his on-screen persona.Salman’s Stardom Rooted in Hard WorkShreya also praised Salman’s dedication, linking it to his long-lasting success. “His stardom is absolutely justified—it’s the result of years of relentless hard work,” she noted. “People assume stars have it easy, but in reality, it takes dedication and consistency to sustain that level of success.” She added that many of Salman’s team members have been with him for decades, a testament to his character.Playing a medical intern in Sikandar, Shreya contributed to the film’s gripping storyline but had little off-camera time with Salman. “If I had pushed myself to talk to him, I’m sure he would have been welcoming,” she said. “But security was tight on set, and we weren’t allowed to bring our phones since the makers were strict about preventing any behind-the-scenes footage from leaking.”Also Read: “I learned so much from Salman Khan”: Shreya Gupto speaks on making her Bollywood debut with Sikandar",

            "description": "Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s upcoming cinematic saga, Love & War, starring Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, and Vicky Kaushal, is generating buzz not just for its star-studded cast but also for its ambitious release strategy. According to a leading daily, industry insiders have revealed that the makers are eyeing a grand Pan-India release for the film, set to hit theaters on March 20, 2026. With Bhansali’s signature grandeur and a trio of Bollywood heavyweights, Love & War could redefine the Pan-India film landscape—here’s everything we know so far.A Pan-India Powerhouse in the MakingReports suggest that Love & War is being crafted as more than just a Bollywood spectacle—it’s poised to conquer audiences across India. “The makers are planning a grand pan-India release for Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Love & War,” an independent industry source told a prominent daily. This move aligns with the growing trend of films transcending regional boundaries, a feat already mastered by South Indian blockbusters like Baahubali and RRR. Bhansali seems ready to tap into this lucrative market, leveraging the nationwide appeal of his leading stars.Ranbir Kapoor and Vicky Kaushal: The Pan-India Game ChangersThe film’s Pan-India ambitions are bolstered by the recent successes of its male leads. “Ranbir and Vicky have recently delivered massive hits with Animal and Chhaava, respectively,” the source noted. Ranbir Kapoor’s Animal (2023) smashed box office records, raking in over Rs 900 crores worldwide, with a strong foothold in Telugu-speaking regions. Similarly, Vicky Kaushal’s Chhaava (2024) has cemented his versatility, resonating beyond Hindi markets. “Both actors have made a stronger impact in these markets, with their films seeing significant success in Telugu territories and beyond,” the insider added, hinting at a built-in audience base for Love & War.Also Read: Alia Bhatt flaunts Ranbir Kapoor’s shoe brand, shares behind-the-scenes from Love & War and more in March photo dump; see pics",

            "description": "Bobby Deol, known for his recent resurgence in Bollywood and OTT, spoke in an exclusive conversation on Bollywood Hungama’s Lights, Camera, Podcast with Rohit Khilnani. The actor opened up about his experience of working in Tamil and Telugu cinema, sharing insights into the differences and challenges he faced.Currently working on his fourth South film, Bobby reflected on his recent success in Telugu cinema. “I had a film (Daaku Maharaaj) that came out at the beginning of this year, and it became a success. It was a massy film, released only in Telugu, with Balakrishna sir. The director’s name was Bobby, such a sweetheart, and it was a big success,” he shared.However, he has experienced both highs and lows while working in the South industry. He also worked on a Tamil film with Suriya titled Kanguva last year that didn’t perform well. “Some films work, some don’t, but it’s been interesting working in the South,” Bobby admitted.When asked if he feels at home in the South industry, Bobby admitted that the language barrier exists but highlighted that the working style feels similar. “It is different. Everyone speaks either Tamil or Telugu, so you do feel a little alienated. But other than that, the working system is almost the same. At the end of the day, you’re just making a film.”Despite his ventures into regional cinema, Bobby’s heart still belongs to Bollywood. He explained that one of the biggest differences is being able to use his own voice in Hindi films. “As an actor, your voice isn’t dubbed. It’s your voice, your performance, it feels complete.”Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: Bobby Deol on his friendship with Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan: “It’s amazing when you reach that level and still stay humble and kind”",

            "description": "Veteran Bollywood filmmaker Subhash Ghai has made headlines with a significant real estate transaction, selling two luxurious apartments in Mumbai’s Jogeshwari for a combined Rs 11.61 crores. The properties, located in the upscale Splendor Complex Co-op Housing Society Ltd., were offloaded in March 2025 under his company, Mukta Tele Arts Private Limited. This move by the “Showman of Bollywood” underscores the thriving luxury property market in Mumbai’s western suburbs and highlights Ghai’s strategic approach to his real estate portfolio.A Lucrative Deal in Jogeshwari’s Splendor ComplexThe two apartments, each fetching Rs 5.80 crores, boast a carpet area of 889 sq ft and a built-up area of 1,067 sq ft, reflecting a premium price point in Jogeshwari’s competitive real estate scene. Registered with a stamp duty of Rs 34.83 lakh per unit and a Rs 30,000 registration fee, the transactions signal strong demand for high-end residences in this well-connected locality. Developed by Oberoi Realty, the Splendor Complex offers modern amenities and proximity to Mumbai’s commercial and entertainment hubs, making it a hotspot for affluent buyers.Why Jogeshwari? Mumbai’s Rising Real Estate StarJogeshwari, nestled in Mumbai’s western suburbs, has emerged as a prime residential destination thanks to its seamless connectivity via the Western Express Highway and Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road (JVLR). With easy access to Andheri’s bustling business districts and Goregaon’s film studios, the area appeals to Bollywood elites like Ghai. The sale of these apartments at over Rs 54,000 per sq ft (built-up area) reflects the suburb’s growing value, driven by infrastructure upgrades and a surge in luxury housing demand in 2025.Subhash Ghai’s Real Estate PlaybookThis isn’t Ghai’s first foray into Mumbai’s property market this year. In February 2025, he and his wife, Mukta Ghai, acquired a sprawling 4BHK apartment in Bandra’s elite 81 Aureate Tower for Rs 24 crores, a purchase that included three parking spaces and a hefty Rs 1.44 crore stamp duty. Just a month prior, in January, the couple sold an Andheri apartment for Rs 12.85 crores, pocketing a 47% profit from their 2016 investment of Rs 8.72 crores.Also Read: Subhash Ghai jokes at Karz screening at Red Lorry Film Festival: “Date during my film and you’ll end up married” – Neetu Kapoor agrees; takes a dig at Filmfare for snubbing Simi Garewal’s performance, says “It’s their LOSS”",

This concealment is often discovered only after the state files counter affidavits, revealing the true criminal antecedents of the accused.A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Manmohan has mandated that individuals submitting special leave petitions must disclose their involvement in other criminal cases. Concealing such information can lead to dismissal of the petition and undermine the legal process.The court has called for changes to rules ensuring comprehensive disclosure, thus safeguarding the integrity of judicial proceedings. The emphasis is on transparency to avoid misuse of judicial leniency and ensure justice is served without prejudice.",

            "description": "Global Markets Plunge Amid Trade Tariff Turmoil Global stocks experienced another day of significant losses on Friday, driven by escalating trade tensions following U.S. President Donald Trump's new tariff announcements. China's response with a 34% tariff on all U.S. goods exacerbated the downward spiral, deeply affecting global markets.Major banking stocks stumbled as fears of an economic slowdown mounted. In response, investors are factoring in aggressive central bank rate cuts. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields dropped to their lowest since October, following a fresh wave of trade tariffs imposed by Trump on U.S. imports.Markets across Europe and Asia witnessed sharp declines, with the STOXX 600 and Nikkei 225 experiencing drops comparable to those during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Futures for the U.S. S&P 500 also reflected the gloom, while commodity prices, notably oil, dipped amid demand concerns.",

            "description": "Gaining weight isn’t just about eating more it’s about eating right. Nutrient-rich foods can help you build muscle, support metabolism, and keep your energy levels up. Peanut butter, almond butter, cashew butter. These spreads are calorie-dense, packed with protein, and full of healthy fats. Add a spoonful to smoothies, toast, or oatmeal. Whole milk, cheese, Greek yogurt—all excellent sources of calories, calcium, and muscle-building protein. Greek yogurt also helps gut health! Creamy and calorie-rich, avocados offer heart-healthy fats and fiber. Use it in sandwiches, smoothies, or on toast with eggs. Rice, oats, quinoa, and whole-grain bread are affordable and full of complex carbs. Carbs help replenish glycogen and fuel workouts. Steak and ground beef are high in protein and iron. They also contain creatine, which supports muscle growth. Choose lean cuts when possible Sweet potatoes, corn, beets, and squash are calorie-dense and rich in nutrients. Bake with olive oil for extra calories and flavor. A perfect food for muscle building loaded with protein, healthy fat, and essential nutrients like choline. Eat them scrambled, boiled, poached, or in an omelet. Almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds—tiny but mighty calorie bombs. Great for snacking, smoothies, or topping your meals. Fatty fish like salmon and sardines are rich in omega-3s and protein. Helps build lean mass while supporting brain and heart health. Homemade smoothies with milk, fruit, nut butter, and protein powder are easy to customize and calorie-dense. Quick, tasty, and perfect post-workout. - Eat more often (5–6 meals a day) - Don’t skip healthy fats - Strength train to build muscle, not just fat - Stay consistent!",

            "description": "Swastika Infra Files for IPO to Power Up Infrastructure Projects Swastika Infra, a Jaipur-based engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) company, has taken a significant step by filing for an Initial Public Offering (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The IPO aims to raise funds to bolster the company's extensive portfolio of power distribution infrastructure projects.The proposed IPO comprises a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 200 crore, alongside an Offer For Sale (OFS) of 19.2 lakh shares by the company's promoters and other stakeholders. The Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) also outlines plans to secure Rs 40 crore in a pre-IPO placement, which could reduce the fresh issue size if completed.Proceeds from the fresh issue are earmarked for addressing the company's incremental working capital needs, with Rs 145 crore allocated for this purpose. Swastika Infra, which has executed over 8,500 circuit kilometers of distribution lines, is managed by book-runners Srujan Alpha Capital Advisors LLP and PhillipCapital (India).",

            "description": "A day after US President Donald Trump announced his far-reaching tariffs, the US stock market faced a brutal sell-off, with the S&P 500 plummeting nearly 5%, erasing over $2 trillion in value — the worst drop since 2020. Investors panicked as President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs fuelled recession fears and uncertainty. Tech giants like Tesla, Nvidia, and Apple saw massive declines, with Tesla alone shedding over 6% in after-hours trading. The chaos spilled over into Asian markets, which opened sharply lower on April 4, 2025. Japan’s Nikkei 225 tumbled over 4%, South Korea’s KOSPI dropped 2.7%, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slid 2.4%, reflecting global unease over Trump’s aggressive trade policies targeting China, Japan, and others. In a surprising twist, Trump addressed the mayhem, stating, “The market’s reaction was anticipated,” suggesting he foresaw the economic turbulence as part of his strategy to “bring wealth back to America.” Critics argue his tariffs could tip the US into a recession, while supporters claim it’s a necessary shake-up.",

            "description": "अपनी छवि और राजनीति को करीने से साधने वाले नीतीश कुमार ने चुनावी साल में बोल्ड डिसीजन लिया है, जो चर्चा का विषय बन गया है। अब तक जानकारों का मानना था कि चुनावों के मद्देनजर JDU मुस्लिम वोटर्स को नाराज नहीं कर सकती, इसलिए वह ऐसा कोई मौका नहीं छोड़ती, जहां उसे मुस्लिम वोटर्स को साधने की जरूरत महसूस होती है। बिहार में इसी साल विधानसभा चुनाव हैं। 2023 की जातीय गणना के आंकड़ों के मुताबिक, राज्य में 17.7% मुस्लिम हैं। जिनका राज्य के करीब 47 सीटों पर प्रभाव है। ऐसे में नीतीश कुमार ने वक्फ बिल पर मोदी का साथ दिया है। मीडिया रिपोर्ट्स की मानें तो पार्टी अध्यक्ष ने अपने सांसदों को स्पष्ट संदेश दिया कि आप मुस्लिम वोटों की चिंता ना करें। सबसे पहले जानिए, भाजपा ने नीतीश को कैसे भरोसे में लिया अब 3 पॉइंट में जानिए, आखिर ऐसा क्या हुआ कि नीतीश कुमार का मुस्लिमों से मोह भंग हो गया? 1. मुस्लिमों के लिए काम किया, लेकिन उन्होंने साथ नहीं दिया 2013 में नीतीश कुमार ने नरेंद्र मोदी के विरोध में 17 साल पुराना NDA का गठबंधन तोड़ दिया। 2014 लोकसभा चुनाव उन्होंने अपने दम पर लड़ा। उन्हें उम्मीद थी कि अपने कोर वोट बैंक के अलावा मुस्लिमों का भी साथ मिलेगा, लेकिन ये उनका भ्रम साबित हुआ। उन्होंने 38 सीटों पर अपने उम्मीदवार उतारे, लेकिन मात्र 2 सीट ही जीत सके। इनमें एक नालंदा और एक पूर्णिया की सीट थी। बाकी 36 सीटों पर उनकी हार हो गई। JDU सूत्रों की मानें तो उसी साल से नीतीश कुमार का दिल टूट गया था। नीतीश कुमार ने वक्फ संशोधन बिल पर खुलकर सरकार को समर्थन करने की अपनी सहमति दे दी थी। उनका मानना था कि हम उनके लिए काम करते हैं, लेकिन वे हमारा सपोर्ट नहीं करते हैं। जदयू के एक नेता ने दैनिक भास्कर को बताया कि पॉलिटिक्स करने के लिए कपड़ा जरूरी है न। ऐसे में जो पार्टी हमें पद और कद दोनों दे रही है, हम उनके एजेंडे का विरोध क्यों करें। इसलिए हमारे नेतृत्व ने इस बिल पर सपोर्ट देने का निर्णय लिया। 2. JDU मान चुकी है उसे मुस्लिम वोट नहीं मिलने वाला JDU के एक बड़े नेता ने नाम नहीं छापने की शर्त पर बताया कि नीतीश कुमार ने 2005 से लेकर अब तक बहुत प्रयास किया कि उन्हें मुस्लिम वोट मिले। 2010 तक थोड़ा बहुत सपोर्ट मिला भी। इसके बाद मुस्लिम इनसे दूर होते चले गए। ऐसे में अब JDU की टॉप लीडरशिप ने इस बात को स्वीकार कर लिया है कि बिहार में मुस्लिम वोट एकतरफा है। ये कुछ भी कर लें, बीजेपी से अलग हो जाएं, आरजेडी के साथ आ जाएं। इन्हें मुस्लिम वोट नहीं मिलने वाला है। ऐसे में इन्होंने बीजेपी को साथ देने का निर्णय लिया। CSDS-लोकनीति के पोस्ट-पोल सर्वे 2020 के मुताबिक, RJD और कांग्रेस के महागठबंधन को 75% मुस्लिम वोट मिले थे। वहीं, BJP और JDU वाले NDA को 5% और चिराग पासवान की पार्टी LJP (रामविलास) को 2% मुस्लिम वोट मिले। 3. कमजोर नीतीश को 2025 के लिए बीजेपी का साथ जरूरी 2020 विधानसभा चुनाव में नीतीश कुमार की पार्टी तीसरे नंबर की बन गई थी। 2005 विधानसभा चुनाव के बाद ऐसा पहली बार हो रहा था जब नीतीश कुमार को बीजेपी से भी कम सीटें हासिल हुई थीं। इसके लिए सबसे बड़ा जिम्मेदार चिराग पासवान को माना गया। 2020 के चुनाव के बाद नीतीश कुमार भले सीएम बने रहे, लेकिन उन्हें दो बार पाला बदलना पड़ा। पहले बीजेपी का साथ छोड़कर वे राजद के साथ गए। इसके बाद दोबारा वे बीजेपी के साथ आए। बिहार में अगले 6 महीने में विधानसभा का चुनाव होना है। नीतीश कुमार की सेहत पर पहले से ही सवाल उठ रहे हैं। जदयू को बिहार में अपनी स्थिति को मजबूत रखने के लिए एक पुराने और भरोसेमंद साथी की जरूरत है। ऐसे में बीजेपी से ज्यादा भरोसेमंद उनके लिए कोई और पार्टी नहीं हो सकती है। ग्राफिक्स के जरिए जानिए, भाजपा का साथ छोड़ने और आने पर नीतीश की पार्टी का क्या हुआ 2015 के बाद से मुस्लिमों का नीतीश कुमार से मोहभंग बात 2024 लोकसभा चुनाव की है। नीतीश कुमार NDA की एक मीटिंग में शामिल थे। यहां सीएम को कहना पड़ा, ‘मुसलमानों को जाकर बताइए, उनके लिए सरकार ने क्या-क्या काम किया है। RJD आ गई तो दंगा फसाद करेगी।’ इस बयान का संदेश साफ था। नीतीश कुमार भी ये मान चुके थे कि इस समाज का अब उनसे मोह भंग हो चुका है। 2024 के लोकसभा और 2020 के विधानसभा चुनाव के नतीजों में नीतीश कुमार की पार्टी के एक भी मुस्लिम कैंडिडेट जीतने में सफल नहीं हो पाए थे। 2015 विधानसभा चुनाव में आखिरी बार JDU से 5 मुस्लिम विधायक जीते थे। 2019 के लोकसभा चुनाव में JDU के एक भी मुस्लिम सांसद नहीं जीत पाए थे। 2020 के विधानसभा चुनाव में जदयू ने 11 मुस्लिम कैंडिडेट को मैदान में उतारा, लेकिन एक भी कैंडिडेट जीतने में सफल नहीं रहे। यही हाल 2024 के लोकसभा चुनाव में भी हुआ, जदयू के एक भी कैंडिडेट चुनाव नहीं जीत पाए। अब जानिए, नीतीश ने मुस्लिमों के लिए क्या किया JDU का दावा है कि 2005 में सत्ता में आने के बाद नीतीश कुमार ने मुस्लिमों की कई पुरानी डिमांड को एक-एक करके पूरा किया। पटना में हज भवन का निर्माण, अंजुमन इस्लामिया की मॉडर्न बिल्डिंग का निर्माण, मदरसा के शिक्षकों की सैलरी सरकारी स्कूल के शिक्षकों के बराबर करना, उर्दू शिक्षकों की बहाली, कब्रिस्तान की घेराबंदी या हर विधानसभा क्षेत्र में आवासीय स्कूल और छात्रावास का निर्माण, हायर एजुकेशन के लिए मुस्लिम छात्रों को स्कालरशिप जैसी कई योजनाएं 2005 से लेकर अब तक शुरू की गई हैं। दो बार BJP से अलग स्टैंड ले चुके हैं नीतीश 1. CAA को समर्थन लेकिन NRC का विरोध नागरिकता संशोधन अधिनियम (CAA) को समर्थन देने के बाद नीतीश कुमार की जनता दल यूनाइटेड (JDU) ने राष्ट्रीय नागरिक रजिस्टर (NRC) का विरोध किया था। मुख्यमंत्री नीतीश कुमार ने यह स्पष्ट कर दिया है कि बिहार में एनआरसी (NRC) लागू नहीं होगा और वे एनपीआर (NPR) पर भी विरोध दर्ज करा चुके हैं। NPR पर नीतीश यह स्पष्ट कर चुके हैं कि 2010 की तर्ज पर ही राष्ट्रीय जनसंख्या रजिस्टर तैयार होना चाहिए। हालांकि नीतीश कुमार ने पहले सीएए (CAA) यानी नागरिकता संशोधन कानून का विरोध किया था, लेकिन बाद में लोकसभा में जेडीयू ने इस बिल का समर्थन दिया था। 2. धारा 370 हटाए जाने का भी जेडीयू ने किया था विरोध धारा 370 हटाए जाने को लेकर भी जेडीयू के अंदर इसी प्रकार का विरोधाभास देखने को मिला था। 5 अगस्त 2019 को धारा 370 हटाए जाने को लेकर वोटिंग के दौरान जनता दल यूनाइटेड के सभी सांसदों ने दोनों सदनों से वॉकआउट कर एक प्रकार से नरेंद्र मोदी सरकार द्वारा लाए गए इस बिल का विरोध ही किया था। ---------------------------------------- ये खबर भी पढ़ें... वक्फ बिल का विरोध, 5 मुस्लिम नेताओं ने JDU छोड़ी:बोले- मुख्यमंत्री ने भरोसा तोड़ा; पप्पू यादव ने कहा- वोटिंग तक ही नीतीश BJP की जरूरत JDU ने वक्फ संशोधन बिल पर मोदी सरकार का समर्थन किया है। इसके बाद से CM नीतीश कुमार की पार्टी में घमासान मचा हुआ है। बगावत शुरू हो गई है। एक के बाद मुस्लिम नेताओं का इस्तीफा जारी है। अब तक बिल को समर्थन देने से नाराज 5 मुस्लिम नेताओं ने पार्टी छोड़ दी है। इनमें प्रदेश सचिव एम. राजू नैयर, अल्पसंख्यक प्रकोष्ठ के प्रदेश सचिव मोहम्मद शाहनवाज मलिक, प्रदेश महासचिव सिए मो. तबरेज सिद्दीकी अलीग, भोजपुर से पार्टी सदस्य मो. दिलशान राईन , और खुद को मोतिहारी के ढाका विधानसभा सीट से पूर्व प्रत्याशी बताने वाले मोहम्मद कासिम अंसारी शामिल हैं। पूरी खबर पढ़ें...",

Notably, the long-term U.S. Treasury yields have fallen to six-month lows amid investor concerns over a potential trade war. The DXI index also slipped to 102, encouraging investors and nations to explore alternative stores of value, such as Bitcoin. Meanwhile, progress on the STABLE Bill and the Senate Banking Committee voting to advance Paul Atkins’ nomination create a friendlier environment for crypto.”CoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, “BTC declined by 0.8%, trading within a range of $81,330 to $83,780. The dip came after the US President Donald Trump announced a list of reciprocal tariffs on several countries, pushing BTC down to the $81,330 level. However, the price rebounded slightly and is now hovering near $83,000. On the technical front, BTC is currently below its 50 and 100 day moving averages but remains above the 200 day moving average. Cryptocurrency market saw $255 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours.”Avinash Shekhar, Co-founder & CEO, Pi42, said, “Bitcoin and the wider crypto space are seeing volatile fluctuations as Trump's tariff revelation shakes global markets. Ethereum has concerns of growing supply and impending hyperinflation, sending alarms ringing among investors. XRP has been able to sustain the $2 support level, chart patterns indicating the potential for a 73% rally in store. Dogecoin, in the meantime, continues to build higher lows, showing consistent buying interest despite larger market uncertainty. The tariff report has fueled selling pressure on Bitcoin, driving it lower, leading many to wonder if this is the beginning of a deeper correction or a transient dip.” Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, “Bitcoin’s recent surge to $88,000 may have marked a local top, with analysts warning of a potential drop if the price slips below $83,500. Market volatility spiked following Trump’s announcement of targeted tariffs on global powers, sparking fears of a trade war. Crypto experts suggest BTC could retest the $78,000-$80,000 range, citing liquidity dynamics. Despite short-term uncertainty, long-term sentiment remains bullish. Drawing from past trends, analysts believe this dip may be temporary before Bitcoin targets new all-time highs. At press time, BTC trades around $83,000—watching closely for its next move in these turbulent global conditions.”CoinDCX Research Team noted, “Bears continue to hold a significant dominance over the crypto markets as the bulls have been failing to offer the required pressure. As a result, the top cryptos like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, BinanceCoin, Cardano, etc., remain consolidated around the lower range. The trading volume has dropped to some extent, suggesting a drop in the bullish and bearish activity. This could keep Bitcoin and the entire market within a range-bound range until either of them exerts more pressure. The US markets face a massive drop followed by growing uncertainty, which has negatively impacted the crypto market.”Subscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabpliveDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

Your Sign lord Saturn and Rahu are extremely close to each other, and this causes a disruptive effect for many signs as this forms what is known as Shraapit Yoga. April also sees the Sun and Venus getting exalted (highest strength) but Mercury and Mars getting debilitated (lowest strength). Your sign lord Saturn has just entered Pisces, and it meets Rahu who is making an exit from Pisces. It is an intriguing phenomenon for sure.",

            "description": "सहारनपुर में आबकारी विभाग द्वारा आवंटित दुकानों का विरोध होना शुरू हो गया है। शहर और ग्रामीण इलाकों की महिलाओं ने सड़क पर नई दुकानों को नहीं खुलने देने की चेतावनी दी। शहर के कपिल विहार, जैन कॉलेज, नोरंगपुर, बेहट और थाना बिहारीगढ़ में शराब के ठेके के विरोध में महिलाओं ने मोर्चा खोल दिया है। जिसके बाद जनप्रतिनिधियों को आना पड़ा। उन्होंने स्कूल, कॉलेजों और मंदिरों के पास नहीं खोलने का आश्वासन दिया। मंदिर और स्कूल के पास शराब का ठेकागांव नोरंगपुर में सुंदरपुर-शाकंभरी मुख्य मार्ग पर पहले से ही देसी शराब का ठेका स्थित है। अब उसी मार्ग पर अंग्रेजी शराब का नया ठेका खोला जा रहा है, जिससे स्थानीय लोग खासकर महिलाएं बेहद नाराज हैं। इस शराब के ठेके से मात्र 500 मीटर की दूरी पर एक मंदिर और स्कूल भी है। क्षेत्रवासियों का कहना है कि कॉलेज जाने वाली छात्राएं इस मार्ग से रोज गुजरती हैं, लेकिन शराब के नशे में असामाजिक तत्व उनके साथ छेड़छाड़ करते हैं। इससे क्षेत्र का माहौल खराब होने की आशंका बनी रहती है। बच्चों पर बुरा असर..लड़कियों से करते हैं छेड़छाड़महिलाओं का आरोप है कि शराब की बढ़ती उपलब्धता के कारण बच्चों में भी शराब का सेवन बढ़ रहा है, जिससे समाज में नकारात्मक प्रभाव पड़ रहा है। महिलाओं का कहना है कि शराब की दुकानों से क्षेत्र में शांति भंग होने का खतरा बढ़ गया है और कभी भी कोई अप्रिय घटना हो सकती है। उन्होंने प्रशासन से मांग की है कि मुख्य मार्ग पर स्थित शराब के ठेके को किसी अन्य स्थान पर स्थानांतरित किया जाए। डीएम कार्यालय पर भी पहुंची महिलाएंइस विरोध प्रदर्शन को लेकर सैकड़ों महिलाएं डीएम कार्यालय पहुंचीं और शराब के ठेके को हटाने की मांग को लेकर जोरदार प्रदर्शन किया। महिलाओं ने कहा कि उनके बच्चों का भविष्य खतरे में है और शराब के नशे में धुत्त लोग उनकी लड़कियों से छेड़खानी करते हैं। उन्होंने प्रशासन पर लापरवाही का आरोप लगाते हुए कहा कि पहले से ही एक देशी शराब का ठेका यहां मौजूद है और अब अंग्रेजी शराब का ठेका खोलने से हालात और बिगड़ सकते हैं। गांव की महिलाओं ने पहले भी बेहट एसडीएम को शराब के ठेके हटाने के लिए ज्ञापन सौंपा था, लेकिन अब तक इस पर कोई ठोस कार्यवाही नहीं हुई। महिलाओं का आरोप है कि शराब की दुकानों के संचालन का समय सुबह 10 बजे से है, लेकिन ठेकेदार सुबह 5 बजे से ही चोरी-छिपे शराब बेचने लगते हैं। इससे इलाके में अव्यवस्था बढ़ रही है। प्रशासन से सख्त कार्यवाही की मांगमहिलाओं और ग्रामीणों ने प्रशासन से मांग की है कि इस शराब के ठेके को तुरंत हटाया जाए और इसे किसी अन्य स्थान पर स्थानांतरित किया जाए। साथ ही, अवैध रूप से सुबह 5 बजे से शराब बेचे जाने की गतिविधियों पर भी सख्त कार्यवाही की जाए। प्रदर्शनकारियों ने चेतावनी दी है कि अगर प्रशासन ने इस पर जल्द कार्यवाही नहीं की तो वे उग्र आंदोलन करने को मजबूर होंगे। ग्रामीण सुमन देवी ने कहा-\"हमारे बच्चों का भविष्य दांव पर है। शराबी लोग हमारी बेटियों के साथ छेड़खानी करते हैं। हम किसी भी हालत में यहां नया ठेका नहीं खुलने देंगे।\" रीना ने कहा-\"हमने कई बार प्रशासन से शिकायत की, लेकिन कोई सुनवाई नहीं हुई। अब हमें सड़कों पर उतरना पड़ा है।\" अजय कुमार का कहना है कि \"अगर प्रशासन ने इस पर ध्यान नहीं दिया तो पूरा गांव एकजुट होकर बड़े आंदोलन की तैयारी करेगा।\"",

            "description": "शाजापुर के मां राजराजेश्वरी मंदिर परिसर में चल रहे 15 दिवसीय चैत्र नवरात्रि मेले में गुरुवार रात एक पागल कुत्ते ने आतंक मचा दिया। रात 9:30 से 10:30 बजे के बीच कुत्ते ने 6 से अधिक लोगों को काट लिया। घायलों में एक 3 वर्षीय बच्ची, एक युवक और एक बुजुर्ग शामिल हैं। सभी घायलों को शाजापुर जिला अस्पताल में भर्ती कराया गया। वहां सभी को रेबीज का इंजेक्शन दिया गया। यातायात थाने के सूबेदार रवि वर्मा ने बताया कि वे खुद भी कुत्ते की चपेट में आ गए। उन्होंने एक बच्ची को बचाने का प्रयास किया था। मेले में कुत्ते के कारण अफरा-तफरी मच गई। रेस्क्यू टीम के देर से पहुंचने के कारण स्थानीय लोगों को कुत्ते को काबू करने में परेशानी हुई। सांडों की लड़ाई में युवक घायल इसी दौरान एक अन्य घटना में ट्रैफिक पॉइंट के पास दो सांडों की लड़ाई के दौरान भरण का एक युवक घायल हो गया। उसका पैर टूट गया और उसे भी जिला अस्पताल में भर्ती कराया गया। स्थानीय प्रशासन और मेला आयोजकों से मेले में सुरक्षा व्यवस्था को मजबूत करने की मांग की जा रही है। साथ ही भविष्य में ऐसी घटनाओं को रोकने के लिए ठोस कदम उठाने की आवश्यकता जताई गई है।",

            "description": "प्रयागराज के श्रृंग्वेरपुर में बने निषादराज गुहा पार्क में पूजन व निषाद समाज के कार्यक्रम में शामिल होने पहुंचे सीएम योगी आदित्यनाथ ने भगवान श्रीराम और निषादराज की मित्रता की चर्चा करते हुए भाजपा सरकार की तरफ से निषाद समाज के लिए चलाई जा रही योजनाओं की बात की। सीएम योगी की यह पूरी कवायद निषाद समाज को भाजपा से जोड़ने के लिए रही। ऐसे में यह कहना गलत नहीं होगा कि सीएम ने ओबीसी वर्ग में बड़ा हिस्सा रखने वाले निषाद समाज को जोड़ते हुए 2027 में होने वाले विधान सभा चुनाव की अभी से तैयारी शुरू कर दी है। प्रदेश में ओबीसी वर्ग में 17 से 18 प्रतिशत है निषाद समाज का हिस्साउत्तर प्रदेश में अगर जाति के हिसाब से देखा जाएं तो ओबीसी वर्ग 36.77 फिसदी हैं। इनमें 17 से 18प्रतिशत निषाद समाज से लोग आते हैं। ऐसे में निषाद समाज उत्तर प्रदेश विधान सभा चुनाव की कई सीटों पर निर्णायक भूमिका में रहता है। यही कारण है कि 2022 के विधान सभा चुनाव में सभी पार्टियां निषाद समाज को अपने साथ मिलाने के लिए हर संभव प्रयास में जुटी रही। हालांकि इसमें भाजपा ने बाजी मारते हुए निषाद पार्टी को अपने साथ रखा। उसका परिणाम रहा कि भाजपा फिर से सत्ता पर काबिज हो सकी। ऐसे में निषाद पार्टी के कार्यक्रम में शामिल होने से लेकर निषादराज की जयंती पर सीएम का आना और उनकी पूजा करना समाज को एक बड़ा संदेश दे गया। जो 2027 में होने वाले विधानसभा चुनाव में अपना असर दिखाएगा। निषाद समाज की यूपी में 140 सीटों पर परिणाम बदलने की है भूमिकानिषाद समाज की बात करें तो प्रदेश में विधान सभा चुनाव के दौरान करीब 140 सीटों पर परिणाम बदलने की भूमिका में यह समाज है। निषाद समाज के अन्तर्गत केवट, बिंद, मल्लाह, कश्यप, नोनिया, मांझी और गोंड जैसी जातियां आती है। इसी कारण भारतीय जनता पार्टी इनको साधने में जुटी है। प्रदेश में गोरखपुर, गाजीपुर, बलिया, संत कबीर नगर, मऊ, मिर्जापुर, भदोही, वाराणसी, प्रयागराज, फतेहपुर, सहारनपुर और हमीरपुर जैसे जिलों में निषाद मतदाताओं की संख्या बहुत अधिक है। प्रयागराज में ही विधानसभा की तीन सीटों पर निषाद समाज का दबदबा है। इसमें यमुनापार में करछना, बारा और गंगापार में हंडिया विधानसभा सीट पर निषाद वोटर निर्णायक भूमिका में हैं। ऐसे में सीएम योगी आदित्यनात निषादराज गुहा की जयंती के बहाने 2027 के होने वाले चुनाव के दौरान निषाद समाज को साधने में कोई कसर छोड़ने को तैयार नहीं हैं।",

            "description": "Lufthansa Faces Challenges from Chinese Airlines in Asian Skies Competition from Chinese airlines, which continue to fly over Russia despite the ongoing conflict, is impacting Lufthansa's business in Asia. Although demand between Europe and China remains strong, overcapacity from Chinese carriers is hurting profitability, according to Lufthansa's Vice President Asia Pacific, Felipe Bonifatti.This trend has been observed since the war in Ukraine and the pandemic, with Chinese airlines gaining a larger share of China's international air traffic. Meanwhile, Lufthansa and other non-Chinese carriers face the challenge of increased travel costs due to rerouting around Russian airspace.Efforts to address these challenges include discussions with Air China about capacity management. Yet, Lufthansa is focusing on maintaining operational stability amidst delivery delays of new aircraft, while continuing to prioritize cost-efficiency in its Asia-Pacific operations.",

            "description": "50 लाख से बढ़ाकर एक करोड़ की गई निधि नगर निगम के सपनों का बजट गुरुवार को पेश किया गया। इस बार शहर का बजट 3611 करोड़ रुपए का रखा गया है। यह पिछले वित्तीय वर्ष से 258 करोड़ रुपए ज्यादा है। पिछला बजट 3353 करोड़ का था। आंकड़ों की इस बाजीगरी में सीवेज, अमृत और स्वच्छ भारत मिशन के बजट में कटौती कर दी गई है। लेकिन झील संरक्षण का बजट दोगुना कर दिया गया। बजट के दौरान एमआईसी सदस्यों की निधि 50 लाख से 1 करोड़ रुपए किए जाने पर हंगामा हो गया। कांग्रेस पार्षदों ने इसका विरोध करते हुए एमआईसी सदस्यों की निधि नहीं बढ़ाने की मांग की। उन्होंने कहा कि उन्हें अलग से बजट क्यों, वे किसी दूसरे के वार्ड में पैसा नहीं खर्च करते हैं। इस पर एमआईसी सदस्य रविंद्र यति भिड़ गए। कहा- अब कोई निधि नहीं होगी। जिस क्षेत्र में जितना संपत्तिकर मिलेगा, वहां उसके हिसाब से ही बजट दिया जाएगा। आप लोगों के वार्ड से तो संपत्ति कर जमा ही नहीं हो रहा। नगर निगम कर्मचारियों को पीटा जाता है। नल के बिल नहीं भरते। इसके बाद हंगामा इतना बढ़ा कि कांग्रेस पार्षदों ने नगर निगम अध्यक्ष किशन सिंह सूर्यवंशी को घेर लिया। इस पर भाजपा पार्षद नारेबाजी करने लगे। काफी देर तक हंगामा चलता रहा। कांग्रेस के पार्षद नगर निगम अध्यक्ष के पास से हटे तो भाजपा पार्षदों ने अध्यक्ष को चारों तरफ से घेर लिया। इस बीच कांग्रेस पार्षद जमीन पर बैठ गए। हंगामा बढ़ते देख अध्यक्ष ने 10 मिनट के लिए बैठक को स्थगित कर दिया। आधे घंटे बाद बैठक शुरू हुई और रात 8 बजे तक ध्वनि मत से बजट पारित कर दिया गया। तीन मुद्दे... जिन पर पार्षदों के बीच हुआ विवाद वन नेशन वन इलेक्शन पर सबसे ज्यादा हंगामा सबसे ज्यादा बहस अलग से रखे गए प्रस्ताव वन नेशन वन इलेक्शन पर हुई। बीजेपी पार्षद सूर्यकांत गुप्ता ने वन नेशन वन इलेक्शन का प्रस्ताव रखा। नेता प्रतिपक्ष शबिस्ता जकी ने कहा, हमें देश हित में जरूर सोचना चाहिए, लेकिन अभी हम नगर निगम के हित में सोच लें। नगर निगम के कर्मचारियों का वेतन नहीं हुआ। उनके बारे में सोचें। कांग्रेस पार्षद बोले- निधि के लिए टैक्स नहीं बढ़ाएं कांग्रेस पार्षद योगेंद्र सिंह गुड्डू चौहान ने पूछा कि 2022 के बाद हाउसिंग फॉर ऑल के तहत कितने नए प्रोजेक्ट आए। जवाब देते हुए छाया ठाकुर ने जब 2018 से शुरू हुए प्रोजेक्ट की जानकारी देना शुरू किया तो कांग्रेस पार्षद बोले- 2022 के बाद के सवाल पर आप 2018 का जवाब दे रही हैं। योगेंद्र ने महापौर से कहा- निधि बढ़ाने के लिए जनता पर कर न थोपें।​​​​​​​ वक्फ बिल पर भाजपा ने की तारीफ, कांग्रेसी भिड़े इसके साथ ही भाजपा पार्षद ने संसद में एक दिन पहले पेश किए गए वक्फ बिल बोर्ड की तारीफ की। इस पर अध्यक्ष सूर्यवंशी ने कहा कि यह अच्छी बात है कि एक अच्छा बिल रखा गया, जिसकी खुशी देश भर में मनाई गई। इस पर नेता प्रतिपक्ष जकी नाराज हो गईं। उन्होंने कहा कि यह मुसलमान की जमीनों को खाने वाला बिल है। विरोध करने वाले भाजपा पार्षदों ने कमिश्नर की तारीफ की... एक दिन पहले तक कमिश्नर हरेंद्र नारायण के खिलाफ मोर्चा खोलने वाले पार्षदों ने कमिश्नर की तारीफ की। कहा- जीआईएस के दौरान बहुत अच्छे काम किए। महापौर ने कहा कि निगम की पूरी टीम लगातार लगी रही। बजट बनाने वाले अपर आयुक्त वित्त गुणवंत सेवतकर और उनकी टीम रात-रात भर लगी रही। कई बार बजट बदला गया। टीम ने बेहतर काम किया। नगर निगम मुख्यालय अटल बिहारी वाजपेयी के नाम परस्मार्ट सिटी द्वारा टीटी नगर में बनाए गए रहवासी आवासों और सेकंड स्टॉप के पास बनाए जा रहे नगर निगम के निर्माणाधीन भवन का नाम पूर्व प्रधानमंत्री अटल बिहारी वाजपेयी के नाम पर किया गया। परिषद में इस संबंध में भाजपा पार्षदों द्वारा प्रस्ताव लाया गया। पिछले बजट में कितना पैसा बचा, नहीं बता पाईं महापौरनेता प्रतिपक्ष जकी ने पूछा कि पिछले बजट में 26 मदों में रखी गई राशि में किस-किस वार्ड में विकास कार्यों के लिए खर्च की गई राशि और कितनी शेष बची है। महापौर मालती राय ने बताया कि सभी मदों की पूरी जानकारी अधिकारियों द्वारा नहीं दी गई है कि कितनी राशि खर्च और कितनी बची है।",

In total, 34 tornadoes were reported across the region, impacting areas from Arkansas to Ohio.The National Weather Service has upgraded the storm's severity, with a level four out of five. Meteorologist Evan Bentley warned of potential intense tornadoes in Northeast Texas and Western Arkansas. Such severe storms are indeed rare, with only 10 to 12 occurring annually.Concerns rise amid a wave of severe weather as NOAA faces workforce reductions initiated by the Trump administration. Despite potential impacts on operations, forecasts remained timely. Climate change exacerbates the situation, with significant rain bringing catastrophic flood potential to vulnerable regions.",

            "description": "Kurian Urges Return of Kerala Land Amid Waqf Board Dispute In a heated session of the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Minority Affairs George Kurian made a strong call for the restitution of land in Munambam, Kerala, which he argued has been unjustly claimed by the Waqf Board. This call was made amid discussions on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025.Kurian emphasized the need for the Waqf Board to present legal documentation proving their ownership. He stated, \"The rightful ownership of the land should be fully restored to the people of Munambam.\" He underscored the necessity for laws to align with constitutional principles protecting minority rights.Residents of Cherai and Munambam villages in Kerala's Ernakulam district have accused the Waqf Board of illegal land claims, despite residents holding registered deeds and tax receipts. Kurian also highlighted that sections of the opposition aim to mislead Kerala's Muslims, whom he described as gentle and pious.",

Reports suggest that the iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max, all powered by the A12 Bionic chip, might not receive the update. However, newer models, starting from the iPhone 11 and the second-gen iPhone SE, are expected to remain compatible. While these older devices may miss out on new features, Apple is likely to continue providing security updates for them. More details will be revealed at WWDC 2025 on June 9 when Apple officially announces iOS 19.",
