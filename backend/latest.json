Gandhi, addressing party workers in Ahmedabad, called for a segregation among Congress members to identify those truly aligned with the party's ideology and the public's interests. He warned of stern measures, including potential expulsions, against those failing to meet the party's standards.Singh contested the notion that the RSS represents Hinduism, alleging it manipulates religious sentiments for political gain. He challenged the RSS and BJP's claim to Hindu traditions, questioning their affiliations with revered Hindu religious leaders.",

            "description": "Syria's Strife: A Nation on the Brink Syria is once again gripped by turmoil as clashes rage between loyalists of ousted President Bashar al-Assad and the new Islamist regime. The conflict, now in its fourth day, has resulted in over 1,000 deaths, mostly civilians, according to a war monitoring group.In a national address, interim leader Ahmed Sharaa blamed remnants of Assad's regime and unnamed foreign backers for the strife. He accused them of attempting to fragment Syria and vowed to hold those culpable accountable. Meanwhile, Kurdish commanders pointed fingers at Turkish-supported factions for escalating violence.The United Nations has called for an emergency Security Council session to address the crisis as Western and Arab states maintain support for Syrian rebels. The conflict, marked by complex factional rivalries, continues to destabilize the region and impose severe humanitarian costs on the Syrian population.",

            "description": "New ICE Leadership Appointed Amid Deportation Pressure Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has announced new leadership for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), signaling a significant shift in the agency's operational strategy. This move comes as ICE faces challenges in aligning with President Donald Trump's aggressive deportation objectives.The Trump administration's deportation figures reveal a noticeable shortfall, with only 37,660 individuals deported during Trump's initial month, compared to the monthly average of 57,000 in the final year of Joe Biden's administration. The recent reassignment of former acting director Caleb Vitello underscores the administration's urgency in bolstering deportation rates.Noem's decision to appoint Todd Lyons as acting director and Madison Sheahan as deputy director marks a definitive effort to increase the agency's effectiveness in fulfilling the American public's expectations regarding illegal immigration. Lyons and Sheahan are tasked with spearheading ICE's initiatives to enhance deportation operations significantly.",

            "description": "कांकेर में पुलिस ने शनिवार-रविवार की रात मुरागांव के आश्रित ग्राम भैसगांव और टोंडामरका से नक्सली होने के संदेह में छह ग्रामीणों को बिना किसी सूचना के गिरफ्तार कर लिया है, जिससे ग्रामीणों में गुस्सा फैल गया। गुरुवार को इस घटना के विरोध में कोतवाली थाने में ग्रामीणों की भीड़ जमा हो गई। जिला पंचायत सदस्य मृदुला भास्कर ने पुलिस की कार्यप्रणाली पर सवाल उठाते हुए कहा कि पुलिस ने कांकेर, कोरर और आमाबेड़ा थाने के अलावा पुलिस अधीक्षक कार्यालय तक चक्कर कटवाया, लेकिन ग्रामीणों की गिरफ्तारी का कारण नहीं बताया गया। पूर्व जिला पंचायत सदस्य ने कहा, ग्रामीणों को नक्सली बताकर फंसाया जा रहा पूर्व जिला पंचायत सदस्य नरोत्तम पडोटी ने कहा कि दो गांवों के छह ग्रामीणों को नक्सली होने का आरोप लगाकर पुलिस ने गिरफ्तार कर लिया है। इस घटना की जानकारी लेने के लिए पूरे क्षेत्र के ग्रामीण कांकेर पहुंचे, लेकिन अब तक उन्हें कोई स्पष्ट जानकारी नहीं मिल सकी है। पुलिस ने एनआईए टीम के आने का हवाला दिया, लेकिन गिरफ्तार ग्रामीणों के बारे में कोई जानकारी नहीं दी गई। पडोटी ने चेतावनी देते हुए कहा कि अगर रविवार तक पुलिस ने स्थिति स्पष्ट नहीं की, तो उग्र आंदोलन किया जाएगा। उन्होंने यह भी कहा कि गिरफ्तार किए गए ग्रामीण खेती-किसानी करने वाले आम नागरिक हैं, जिन्हें नक्सली बताकर फंसाया जा रहा है। ​​​​​​पुलिस ने 5 को फरार नक्सली घोषित कर उठाया पकड़े गए लोगों में टोंडामरका के 70 वर्षीय चंदन सिंह सलाम, सन्तु राम हुपेंडी और कार्तिक राम उसेण्डी शामिल हैं। भैसगांव से सोमारू राम कावड़े, फूलसिंह कावड़े और लक्ष्मण नुरेटि को हिरासत में लिया गया है। सभी खेती-किसानी करने वाले हैं। पुलिस के अनुसार, ये सभी 2015 से फरार नक्सली आरोपी थे, जिन्होंने ग्राम भैसगांव और टोंडामरका में तीन ग्रामीण परिवारों के साथ मारपीट कर उन्हें धमकी दी थी और गांव छोड़ने पर मजबूर किया था। ग्रामीणों ने चेतावनी दी है कि यदि रविवार तक पुलिस ने जानकारी नहीं दी, तो वे उग्र आंदोलन करेंगे। स्थानीय नेताओं का कहना है कि पहाड़ी क्षेत्र के ये ग्रामीण नक्सली नहीं हैं। पुलिस ने 5 ग्रामीणों को फरार नक्सली बताकर भेजा जेलकांकेर पुलिस अनुविभागीय अधिकारी मोहसिन खान और कोरर थाना प्रभारी जितेंद्र गुप्ता ने बताया कि 8 मार्च को पुलिस ने अति नक्सल प्रभावित गांव पीढापाल, भैंसगांव, बुधियारमारी और टोंडामरका में फरार नक्सली सहयोगियों की तलाश में दबिश दी थी। इस दौरान पांच फरार नक्सली आरोपियों को गिरफ्तार किया गया। फूलसिंह कावड़े की गिरफ्तारी पर उठे सवालहिरासत में लिए गए लोगों की सूची में शामिल फूलसिंह कावड़े को लेकर संदेह बना हुआ है। पूर्व जिला पंचायत सदस्य नरोत्तम पडोटी ने बताया कि छह लोगों को हिरासत में लेने का आरोप लगाया गया था, लेकिन पुलिस ने केवल पांच लोगों को नक्सली घोषित कर जेल भेज दिया, जबकि छठे व्यक्ति फूलसिंह कावड़े को लेकर स्थिति स्पष्ट नहीं है। इस बारे में जब एसडीओपी कांकेर मौसिन खान से पूछा गया, तो उन्होंने कहा कि मामला कोरर थाने से संबंधित है। उन्होंने संभावना जताई कि फूलसिंह कावड़े को या तो थाने में छोड़ दिया गया होगा या वह ग्रामीणों के साथ वापस चला गया होगा। फिलहाल, इसकी जांच की जा रही है। ग्रामीणों की चेतावनी, रविवार तक जानकारी नहीं दी तो होगा आंदोलनग्रामीणों ने प्रशासन को चेतावनी दी है कि अगर रविवार तक पुलिस ने स्पष्ट जानकारी नहीं दी, तो वे उग्र आंदोलन करेंगे। स्थानीय नेताओं ने भी इस मुद्दे को गंभीर बताते हुए कहा कि पकड़े गए ग्रामीण निर्दोष हैं और उन्हें नक्सली बताकर फंसाया जा रहा है।",

            "description": "If you’ve been struggling with restlessness, disturbed sleep, or waking up tired, simple Vastu adjustments may be the solution. Let’s dive into the best sleep directions, ideal bed placements, and quick Vastu tips to improve your sleep quality. Best Sleeping Directions as Per Vastu Ideal Sleeping Directions 1. South (Best for Deep Sleep & Overall Well-Being) - According to Vastu, sleeping with your head towards the south and feet pointing north is the best option. - This position aligns with Earth’s magnetic field, promoting deep sleep, relaxation, and overall well-being. 2. East (Great for Mental Clarity & Spiritual Growth) - If you’re a student, professional, or someone who needs mental alertness, east-facing sleep can help. - It enhances concentration, memory, and creativity. Avoid These Sleeping Directions 1. North (Causes Restlessness & Health Issues) - Sleeping with your head towards the north is considered inauspicious. - It is believed to disrupt energy balance, leading to disturbed sleep, stress, and even health issues like headaches and anxiety. 2. West (Can Lead to Stress & Delays in Success) - While not as harmful as the north, west-facing sleep is believed to cause unnecessary struggles and delays in personal and professional success. - It may also lead to a restless mind, making it harder to wake up feeling refreshed. Vastu Tips for the Perfect Bed Placement 1. Place the Bed in the Southwest or South - The bed should ideally be positioned in the southwest or south corner of the bedroom for stability and relaxation. - Avoid placing it in the center of the room, as it disrupts energy flow. 2. Avoid Sleeping Under a Beam - If your bed is placed directly under a ceiling beam, it can create pressure and stress, leading to disturbed sleep. - If shifting the bed isn’t an option, consider false ceiling panels or wooden décor to neutralize the effect. 3. Keep the Bed Away from the Bedroom Door - Your bed should not be directly aligned with the bedroom door, as it can lead to disrupted energy flow and restlessness. - The best position is diagonally opposite to the entrance. 4. Use a Solid Headboard for Support - A strong wooden headboard provides a sense of security and stability, promoting peaceful sleep. - Avoid metal headboards, as they may create unnecessary distractions and energy disturbances. 5. No Mirrors Facing the Bed - Mirrors reflecting your bed can cause insomnia and increase mental stress. - If you have a mirror or dressing table opposite your bed, cover it at night to prevent negative effects. 6. Declutter Your Bedroom - Cluttered spaces lead to a cluttered mind. Keep your bedroom organized and free from unnecessary items. - Avoid storing things under your bed, as stagnant energy can impact your sleep quality. 7. Soothing Colors & Soft Lighting - Light pastel shades like blue, lavender, or white promote relaxation and peace. - Avoid dark or overly bright colors, which can create agitation. Bonus: Quick Vastu Fixes for Better Sleep - Use Himalayan salt lamps or essential oils like lavender to create a calming atmosphere. - Avoid placing electronics near your bed, as they emit radiation and disturb sleep cycles. - Keep a bowl of water with sea salt in the bedroom to absorb negative energy. - Sleep on a wooden bed instead of metal for better energy flow. Applying Vastu principles to your sleeping space doesn’t require a major transformation small tweaks can make a big difference in improving sleep quality. By aligning your bed placement and sleeping direction with positive energy flow, you can enjoy deeper rest, wake up feeling refreshed, and experience better health and well-being.",

            "description": "कल से विधानसभा का बजट सत्र शुरू हो रहा है। सत्र के पहले ही दिन भोपाल में विभिन्न समस्याओं और वादाखिलाफी के विरोध में किसान कांग्रेस विधानसभा का घेराव करेगी। इस घेराव की जानकारी देने के लिए बुलाई गई प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस में कांग्रेस के वरिष्ठ नेता और पूर्व मंत्री सज्जन सिंह वर्मा ने कहा कि \"लाड़ली बहना\", \"किसान सम्मान निधि\" जैसी फ्री-बीज़ योजनाओं को बीजेपी खुद सुप्रीम कोर्ट जाकर बंद करवा देगी। बिहार विधानसभा चुनाव के एक महीने बाद ही ये योजनाएं बंद हो सकती हैं। पूर्व मंत्री सज्जन सिंह वर्मा ने कहा- बिहार के चुनाव सामने हैं। इसलिए ये फ्री-बीज की एक नई पॉलिसी लेकर आ रहे हैं। चूंकि, बीजेपी को बिहार का चुनाव जीतना है। वैसे कई राज्यों में वह जीत चुकी है। चूंकि, लाड़ली बहना और महाराष्ट्र सहित तमाम ऐसी स्कीम एक्सपोज हो गई हैं। इसलिए फ्री-बीज की एक नई पॉलिसी ला रहे हैं। सज्जन बोले- सिर्फ भाषणों से नहीं होगा किसानों का सशक्तिकरण सज्जन सिंह वर्मा ने कहा- किसान कांग्रेस के नेतृत्व में कल विधानसभा का घेराव किया जाएगा। मैं देखता हूं कि जब भी किसान का मामला आता है तो हम शहर वाले लोगों को लगता है कि कहां बात हो रही है? जबकि इस देश में 60 प्रतिशत आबादी किसान की है। हम पल बढ़ रहे हैं तो उसके पीछे किसान हैं। सिर्फ मोदी जी और मोहन यादव के भाषण देने से किसान का सशक्तिकरण और किसान मजबूत नहीं हो सकता। हमारी बहुत लंबे समय से मांग है कि गेहूं का भाव 3 हजार रुपए प्रति क्विंटल किया जाए। बीजेपी ने 26 सौ रुपए में गेहूं खरीदी कराने की घोषणा की है। व्यापारी 3 हजार में गेहूं खरीद रहे तो सरकार क्यों नहीं खरीदती? सज्जन वर्मा ने कहा- अखबार उठाकर देख लीजिए कल इंदौर की मंडी में 3 हजार से 3100 रुपए क्विंटल गेहूं व्यापारी ने खरीदा है तो सरकार 2600 रुपए पर खरीदकर किसान को क्या ठगना चाहती है। किसान की 3 हजार की मांग वाजिब है। किसान ज्यादा पैसे के लालच में व्यापारी को बेचता है। कई बार कुछ फर्जी व्यापारी किसानों का करोड़ों रुपए गेहूं खरीदकर गायब हो जाते हैं। इसलिए हम दबाव डालते हैं कि सरकार 3 हजार रुपए गेहूं का मूल्य करें। ये पूरी कांग्रेस पार्टी चाहती है। कल से मप्र विधानसभा का बजट सत्र है। भोपाल में बड़ी इन्वेस्टर्स मीट हुई। अब तक के इतिहास का सबसे बड़ा मीट 4 लाख 20 हजार करोड़ के एमओयू साइन हुए। शिवराज चौहान के कार्यकाल में 7-8 मीट हुई। उनके सारे मीट जोड़ लो तो करीब साढे़ 13 लाख करोड़ के एमओयू हुए थे। उनमें से 5 फीसदी भी धरातल पर नहीं उतरे। हम इन्वेस्टर्स मीट के आलोचक नहीं हैं। प्रदेश को आगे बढ़ाने के लिए ये जरूरी है। लेकिन, वाहवाही लूटने के लिए लंबे-चौड़े आंकडे़ प्रस्तुत कर देना ये मप्र के हित में नहीं हैं। बाबा रामदेव को 5 साल पहले 50 एकड़ जमीन मिली, ₹1 खर्च नहीं कियासज्जन वर्मा ने कहा- 5 साल पहले जब इन्वेस्टर्स मीट हुई थी। तब पतंजलि के फूं-फां करने वाले बाबा रामदेव को 50 एकड़ जमीन दी गई थी। उन्होंने कहा था हम 500 करोड़ रुपए खर्च करेंगे। पीथमपुर में आप देखिए एक कौड़ी खर्च नहीं की। इतना बड़ा उदाहरण होने के बाद भी इस इन्वेस्टर्स समिट के आरंभ में ही अधिकारी दौड़ते हुए जाते हैं और बाबा रामदेव के साथी बालकृष्ण को 432 एकड़ जमीन देने का लेटर देकर आ गए। इतना तो अंधा भी समझता है कि 50 एकड़ जमीन देने पर कुछ नहीं किया। अब 432 एकड़ जमीन इसलिए दी ताकि आंकडे बढ़े हुए दिखे। हमारा ये मुद्दा रहेगा कि पिछली सात-आठ इन्वेस्टर्स मीट में जो एमओयू हुए थे उनमें से कितने धरातल पर उतरे और इस बार की समिट में जो एमओयू हुए उनमें से कितने लोगों ने आगे एग्रीमेंट किया? दिग्विजय सिंह जब मुख्यमंत्री थे। तब मैं मंत्री हुआ करता था। बजट सत्र 75 दिन चलता था। अभी तो मैं समझता हूं कि 5-6 दिन में ही खत्म कर देंगे। किसान कांग्रेस के अध्यक्ष बोले- मोदी गारंटी एक भी पूरी नहीं हुईकिसान कांग्रेस के प्रदेश अध्यक्ष धर्मेन्द्र सिंह चौहान ने कहा 2023 के चुनाव के पहले जो मोदी गारंटी दी गई थी। उन मोदी गारंटियों के खिलाफ किसान कांग्रेस के साथ पूरी पार्टी विधानसभा का घेराव करेगी। बीजेपी ने किसानों के लिए वादे किए थे कि 2700 रुपए क्विंटल में गेहूं, 3100 रुपए क्विंटल में धान खरीदेंगे। लाडली बहना को 3 हजार रुपए देंगे। 450 रुपए में गैस का सिलेंडर देंगे। बीजेपी ने किसानों के साथ छलावा किया। एक भी मोदी गारंटी पूरी नहीं की। अभी तो हम विधानसभा घेराव कर रहे हैं। जरूरत पड़ी तो मुख्यमंत्री निवास घेरेंगे। मंत्रियों का घेराव करेंगे और उनके घर के सामने धरना देंगे। किसान कांग्रेस की मुख्य मांगें",

            "description": "To celebrate Aamir Khan's 60th birthday on March 14, PVR INOX announced Aamir Khan: Cinema Ka Jadugar, a special film festival honouring his impact on Indian cinema. The festival's trailer launch featured lyricist and screenwriter Javed Akhtar.At a press conference, veteran screenwriter Javed Akhtar made a bold prediction about Aamir’s next film. “I know I’m pouring my neck on line. But I’ve put my neck on line before and have been proven right. I was the one who said Aamir will be superstar, Amitabh after series of flop I predicted that he will become a superstar. Today I’m predicting that the film which will connect with everyone is being made by Aamir. That film will be a super hit.”Akhtar emphasized Aamir’s unique ability to succeed across genres, unlike past Bollywood legends who stuck to one style. He credited Aamir’s mentor, Nasir Hussain, as an underrated force who shaped stars like Dev Anand and Shammi Kapoor.Akhtar revealed he initially advised Aamir against the project. “Aamir’s magic is that he put his money on unconventional films. I asked him not to do Lagaan. Tried convincing him a lot. I made a list on what all was wrong. He made a list and made a script with all those things. Then I gave up, Ki film to Aamir ko chalani hai. But when I saw the first cut I was blown away.”Akhtar praised Aamir for backing films like Taare Zameen Par and Dangal, roles that few actors would dare to take. “People don’t make Taare Zameen Par. People don’t work in. dangal. He was the actor in RDB who was sitting in a corner and letting other actor take center stage. Only Aamir could have believed in these character and stories.”He added, “Aamir did a film with Ashutosh with whose he had a flop before. Who would have done Dangal in their right mind. Role of such an old man who loses to his daughter in kushti. All actors work in films of directors who have given hits. You take chances no other can,” he added.He also shared a personal connection, revealing that Aamir’s first film was written by him and that his son, Farhan Akhtar, directed his debut (Dil Chahta Hai) with Aamir as the lead. “Aamir was waiting for my call after initially rejecting Farhan’s script. When I didn’t call, he realized that Farhan truly believed in him.”With Javed Akhtar’s ringing endorsement and a legacy of bold choices, all eyes are now on Aamir Khan’s next film.Also Read : Javed Akhtar on why he called off his legal battle with Kangana Ranaut; says, “She has given a letter of regret and apologies”",

            "description": "IIFA Awards completes 25 years and its celebrations are going on in full swing at Jaipur, Rajasthan. Coincidentally, Sholay (1975) completes 50 years this year. Meanwhile, Jaipur’s iconic single screen cinema hall, Raj Mandir, will step into its 50th year soon. Hence, all these three entities joined hands. The screening of Sholay was held on Sunday, March 9, at Raj Mandir by IIFA and it turned out to be a memorable affair. The screening was attended by Sholay’s director Ramesh Sippy, fellow reputed filmmaker Sooraj Barjatya and the who’s who of Jaipur.After a wonderful speech by Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Princess Diya Kumari, Sooraj Barjatya and Ramesh Sippy came on stage to speak about their love for films and how they managed to make such historic blockbusters.Sooraj Barjatya said, “It’s a very emotional moment for all of us at Rajshri. My uncle and my tauji wanted to be here but couldn’t because of their health. Our association with Raj Mandir dates back to 1977.”He then shared an interesting anecdote regarding his debut directorial, “I remember Maine Pyar Kiya (1987) was screened here and I had paid a visit. I was very nervous. But the projectionist of Raj Mandir told me, ‘Aapka hero hit hai, aapka kabootar hit hai’! I went back and told Salman Khan bhai about it that ‘Khabar aayi hai ki aap hit hai’!”On this special occasion, the management of Raj Mandir changed their seats. The new seats are far more comfortable and it sets a new benchmark for other single screen theatres that they need to upgrade their facilities, especially when the competition from multiplexes is so immense.Outside the theatre, the organizers had installed a scooter with sidecar, which has now become synonymous with Sholay. The background was pink coloured and it went well with the ‘Pink City’ reference of Jaipur.Also Read: Sholay’s 50th anniversary celebration at Raj Mandir Jaipur: Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Princess Diya Kumari hails Ramesh Sippy, Sooraj Barjatya: “NO Hollywood film can match Sholay or Hum Aapke Hain Koun”",

            "description": "सतना में 5वीं और 8वीं क्लास की परीक्षाओं का मूल्यांकन काम रविवार से शुरू हो गया है। हालांकि, इस बार उत्तर पुस्तिकाओं का मूल्यांकन जिले के बाहर न भेजे जाने से निष्पक्षता पर सवाल उठ रहे हैं। जिला मुख्यालय स्थित डाइट और ब्लॉक स्तर पर कॉपियों की जांच की जा रही है। पहली बार बोर्ड पैटर्न पर हुई इन परीक्षाओं का मूल्यांकन ब्लॉक स्तर पर ब्लॉक बदलकर किया जा रहा है। जिला मुख्यालय में शहरी क्षेत्र के 64 केंद्रों की कॉपियों का मूल्यांकन एक ही परिसर में हो रहा है। 382 में से 135 शिक्षक ही पहुंचे इसके अलावा, मूल्यांकन में शिक्षकों की कमी भी एक बड़ी समस्या बन गई है। डाइट में मूल्यांकन के लिए 382 शिक्षकों की आवश्यकता है, लेकिन रविवार को केवल 135 शिक्षक ही उपस्थित हुए। इसका मुख्य कारण यह है कि माध्यमिक शिक्षा मंडल की 10वीं और 12वीं की परीक्षाएं चल रही हैं, जिनमें अधिकांश शिक्षक व्यस्त हैं। गौरतलब है कि पिछली बार उत्तर पुस्तिकाएं रीवा भेजी गई थीं, लेकिन इस बार मूल्यांकन जिले तक ही सीमित रखा गया है। यह निर्णय कई सवालों को जन्म दे रहा है और शिक्षा विभाग की कार्यप्रणाली पर प्रश्नचिह्न लगा रहा है।",

This time, the crime took place in Karnataka’s Koppal district. Reports indicate that two women were sexually assaulted, one of whom is an Israeli tourist visiting India. She was accompanied by three male friends, who were brutally beaten by the attackers and thrown into a canal. On the morning of March 8, authorities recovered the body of one of the victims. As of now, the police have not yet identified the perpetrators. This tragic incident has once again raised concerns about tourist safety in India.",

Consequently, unsold inventory decreased 15% to 12,494 units. Price stability was maintained, with per square foot rates between Rs 3,134 and Rs 15,833.Pankaj Kapoor from Liases Foras highlighted the potential for further real estate development in Nashik.

            "description": "Thackeray Demands Mumbai Parity with Gujarat's GIFT City Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray has accused the BJP of deliberately undermining Mumbai's economic position by shifting major projects to Gujarat and Delhi. Speaking at a party event, he demanded subsidies and facilities for Mumbai akin to those provided to Gujarat's GIFT City.Thackeray criticized the BJP's strategies, which he argues have led to the relocation of corporate headquarters away from Mumbai, questioning the long-term impact on Maharashtra's economy. He emphasized that Mumbai, as the backbone of India's economy, should not lose its prominence.He also raised concerns about the involvement of private entities, like the Adani Group, in projects near the Navi Mumbai airport and criticized delays in Mumbai's infrastructure development. Thackeray expressed disappointment over the decline in healthcare services in the city's civic hospitals and vowed to oppose any detrimental policies.",

            "description": "Court Denies Bail in High-Profile Sexual Harassment Case A Thane court has denied the bail application of an educational institute chairman accused of rape and sexual harassment. The judge cited the ongoing investigation and substantial evidence against Rameshchandra Shobnath Mishra as reasons for the decision.Mishra, arrested on January 30, is accused of demanding payments and coercing a woman into a sexual relationship under the guise of offering employment. The victim claims she paid Rs 6 lakh but faced further exploitation when she refused to comply further.The defense pointed to the victim's lack of qualifications and Mishra's health issues, arguing for bail. However, the prosecution highlighted similar accusations by other women and the necessity for continued investigation. The court ruled against bail, referencing multiple Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita charges.",

            "description": "Indore (Madhya Pradesh) [India], March 9 (ANI): A third-year college student allegedly died by suicide after jumping from the third floor of his college in Dwarkapuri, Indore, police said on Sunday. The incident took place on Saturday, and from his social media status, police say they suspect that his mental state was not sound. Anand Yadav, Additional DCP Zone 4, said, \"This is an incident of the Dwarkapuri police station area where a boy named Mayur Rajput, who was a BSc third-year student, jumped from the third floor of the college and committed suicide from there. Right now, we are investigating the reason. So far, it has been found that he had posted something on his social media status in which he had written that neither could I become a good student nor a good son. He has done something like this in his mental state.\" The police are currently investigating the case. \"We are investigating the rest. In the investigation, all these things will be discussed with the family members, and once all the talks are done, everything will be clear. He is a third-year student, so his age will be between 19 and 20 years,\" he further said. (ANI)",

            "description": "Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, is considered a sacred period in which Allah bestows His blessings, mercy, and opportunities for worship upon His followers. During this holy month, Muslims across the world observe fasting, known as Sawm in Arabic. The fast continues throughout the entire month, and as of March 9, 2025, one week of fasting will be completed, with the eighth fast being observed on Sunday.ALSO READ: Ramadan 2025: Maintaining Hydration During The Fasting — Expert RecommendationsFasting In Ramadan: A Spiritual DevotionFasting in Ramadan is not merely about abstaining from food and drink. It is a time when Muslims exercise self-control, engage in worship, seek forgiveness, and strive for spiritual growth. Observing the fast is an essential practice in Islam, as it is one of the five pillars of the faith. Ramadan offers believers a golden opportunity to connect with Allah through fasting, prayers, Taraweeh, charity (Zakat and Sadaqah), and other acts of devotion.Significance Of Sehri And Iftar During RamadanOne of the most crucial aspects of fasting is observing Sehri and Iftar. Sehri refers to the pre-dawn meal consumed before beginning the fast, while Iftar marks the breaking of the fast at sunset. Without these two essential practices, the process of fasting is considered incomplete. Hence, it is important for all fasting individuals to ensure that they eat at the right times.As Sehri and Iftar timings vary across different cities by a few minutes, here are the iftar timings for Sunday, March 9, 2025, in major Indian cities:Ramadan 2025: Iftar Timings For March 9 In India:Delhi: 06:29 PMMumbai: 06:47 PMHyderabad: 06:33 PMKanpur: 06:16 PMLucknow: 06:14 PMKolkata: 05:44 PMMeerut: 06:27 PMNoida: 06:28 PMBengaluru: 06:34 PMAhmedabad: 06:48 PMPatna: 05:57 PMRanchi: 05:59 PMChennai: 06:20 PM[Disclaimer: The content of this article is based solely on beliefs, and should be taken as general guidance.

            "description": "Labor Party's Resounding Victory in Western Australia Australia's Labor Party celebrated a decisive re-election victory in Western Australia on Saturday, solidifying its position ahead of the anticipated national election due by mid-May. The win reinforces the party's dominance, further bolstering the standing of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, despite notable challenges posed by high living costs.Western Australia's Premier Roger Cook expressed gratitude, emphasizing his commitment to serving the state. As results poured in, the Labor Party secured 40 seats while the Liberal opposition lingered with just four, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corp's latest figures.Prime Minister Albanese hailed the result as an 'extraordinary' achievement, attributing part of the success to the government's effective pandemic response and appealing family policies. The victory underscores Labor's robust hold in Western Australia, having won a historic number of seats in both state and federal elections since March 2021.",

            "description": "मेरा नाम शब्बीर खान है। यूपी के बांदा जिले के गोयरा मुगली गांव में रहता हूं। 14 फरवरी की बात है। देर रात घर पर सब सो रहे थे। अचानक फोन बजा। इंटरनेशनल नंबर देखकर मेरे रोंगटे खड़े हो गए। अंदाजा हो गया था कि कोई बुरी खबर होगी। ये फोन दुबई की जेल से आया था। फोन उठाते ही सिसकियां सुनाई दीं। मेरी शहजादी, मेरी बेटी रो रही थी। रोते हुए बोली, अब्बू मेरा टाइम खत्म हो गया। आज मुझे फांसी हो जाएगी। मुझसे कहा गया है कि केवल दस मिनट हैं तुम्हारे पास, जिससे बात करना है कर लो। मैं एक मजबूर बाप सिर्फ इतना ही कह सका कि बेटा रो मत। बेटी को उस आखिरी 10 मिनट में भी हमारी ही फिक्र थी। उस वक्त भी वो यही कह रही थी कि आप लोग अपना ध्यान रखिएगा। मेरी चिंता न कीजिएगा। अब मैं सुकून से रहूंगी। सारे मुकदमे वापस ले लीजिएगा, लेकिन उजैर को नहीं छोड़िएगा। मैं कुछ भी न कह सका, सिर्फ हां-बेटा!, हां-बेटा बोलता रहा। 22 दिन हो गए मेरी बेटी की मौत को। आज भी उसके वो आखिरी शब्द मेरे कानों में गूंजते हैं। उसकी बातें मुझे बहुत तकलीफ देती हैं। उसे मालूम था कि तीन घंटे बाद मरना है, फिर भी वो हमें समझा रही थी। ये बात मुझे रोज परेशान करती है। उसको उसी दिन यानी 15 फरवरी की सुबह फांसी दे दी गई। शहजादी पर चार माह के बच्चे के कत्ल का आरोप था। जब वो छोटा बच्चा मरा, तो बेटी उसके कब्र पर गई थी। लौटकर आई तो वीडियो कॉल पर अपनी मां से कह रही थी कि मुझे वहां सुकून मिला। ऊपर वाले ने उसकी सुन ली है। उसे भी वहीं दफना दिया गया, जहां उस बच्चे को दफनाया गया, जिसकी मौत का आरोप मेरी बेटी पर लगा था। मेरी बेटी पर झूठे आरोप लगाकर फांसी दिलवाने वालों ने अपने रसूख का इस्तेमाल किया। उस बच्चे का पोस्टमॉर्टम तक रुकवा दिया गया था, जिसके मरने के 52 दिन बाद मेरी बच्ची पर मुकदमा कर दिया गया। उसे महीनों खलीफा सीटी पुलिस स्टेशन में रखा। इतना सबकुछ हुआ, लेकिन बेटी को बचाया नहीं जा सका। मुझे बेटी की डेड बॉडी तक नहीं मिली। उसके कब्र की मिट्टी भी मिल जाती तो हमें थोड़ा सुकून होता। उसकी केवल यही गलती थी कि वो ‘आम लड़कियों’ जैसा दिखना चाहती थी। बचपन में उसने एकबार मुझसे कहा था कि पापा प्लास्टिक सर्जरी करा दो, मैंने कह दिया था कि मेरे पास इतना पैसा नहीं है। उस दिन के बाद उसने कभी मुझसे कुछ नहीं कहा। दरअसल, मेरी बेटी शहजादी नौ साल की थी। एक दिन किचन में खाना बनाते हुए उसका कमर से ऊपर का हिस्सा जल गया। इलाज कराया, लेकिन चेहरे के दाग नहीं गए। स्कूल में बच्चे उसके चेहरे को लेकर कुछ न कुछ कह देते थे। घर आकर अपनी मां से रोती थी। कहती थी प्लास्टिक सर्जरी करवा दो, उससे चेहरा ठीक हो जाएगा। तब प्लास्टिक सर्जरी का खर्च कम से कम पांच लाख था। मैंने मना कर दिया कि बेटा हमारी हैसियत नहीं है। एक बार इलाज के लिए कानपुर गई थी। वहां से आकर बताया कि डॉक्टर ने कहा है कि शरीर थोड़ा मजबूत करो फिर देखते हैं। एक ऑपरेशन हुआ भी था, लेकिन वो चाहती थी कि थोड़ी सुंदर हो जाए। धीरे-धीरे उसने हमसे इस बारे में बात करना बंद कर दिया। कभी इस बात का एहसास भी नहीं होने दिया कि वो अभी भी आम लड़कियों जैसा दिखना चाहती है। वो कुछ कहती नहीं थी तो हमें लगता था कि इस चेहरे के साथ ही खुश है अब। मुझे अफसोस इस बात का है कि मैं बेटी को समझ नहीं पाया। वो अपनी बात मुझसे कह नहीं पाई। स्कूल में एक एनजीओ वाली दीदी के साथ ही काम करने लगी। कहती थी शादी नहीं करेगी। हम लोग भी मान गए। हमें लगता था कि चेहरा जला है, तो कोई उससे शादी करेगा भी नहीं। शहजादी एनजीओ के काम में रच-बस गई थी। जाने कब उसने फेसबुक पर उजैर से दोस्ती कर ली। एकाध बार घर भी आया था। हमें यही लगता कि एनजीओ में काम करता है। हमें नहीं पता था कि वो बदमाश है। उस पर तो मुकदमे भी हैं। उजैर ने पहले मेरी बेटी से शादी का वादा किया। उसे प्लास्टिक सर्जरी का भी लालच दिया। शहजादी से कहा कि दुबई में चेहरे की सर्जरी कराएगा। शहजादी ने कहा- घरवाले दुबई नहीं भेजेंगे। उजैर ने कहा- घरवालों को मत बताना। मेरी बेटी ने उजैर की बात मान ली। हमें ये बताकर तीन महीने के लिए दुबई चली गई कि एनजीओ के काम से जा रही है। वो दुबई जाने के नाम पर इतनी खुश थी कि हम ज्यादा कुछ कह ही नहीं सके। जिस दिन वो घर से जा रही थी, मन में एक अजीब सी बेचैनी थी। वो बार-बार कह रही थी चिंता मत करो, मैं रोज वीडियो कॉल करूंगी। बस तीन महीने की तो बात है। वो नवंबर 2021 में घर से गई थी। उजैर ने कहा था पहले तुम जाओ फिर मैं भी अबुधाबी आ जाऊंगा। उसने शहजादी को अपने बुआ-फूफा का नंबर दिया था। उसके फूफा का नाम फैज और बुआ का नाम नाजिया है। अबुधाबी में उनका घर है। उजैर की बुआ पुलिस में बड़ी अधिकारी है और फूफा वहां एक यूनिवर्सिटी में पढ़ाता है। मैंने दोनों से वीडियो कॉल पर बात की है। दोनों का काफी रसूख है। शहजादी उनके घर पर ही रहती थी, लेकिन कभी नहीं बताया कि उसे नौकर की तरह रखा जाता था। उसके जाने के चार महीने बाद नाजिया को बेटा हुआ। वो वीडियो कॉल करती थी और सब कुछ दिखाती थी। जब बच्चा हो गया तो एक दिन मैंने वीडियो कॉल पर कहा, तुम अब उनके घर में न रहो। अपने एनजीओ वालों के साथ रहो, क्या दिक्कत है? वो टाल जाती थी। अपनी मां से कहती थी कि बच्चे में मन लग गया है। एकबार टीका लगवाने के बाद नाजिया के बेटे की तबीयत खराब हो गई। वीडियो कॉल पर मेरे ही सामने नाजिया को कॉल करके बच्चे की तबीयत के बारे में बताया। नाजिया ने कहा कि उसे दूध पिला दो। तब नाजिया की मां भी घर पर थी। बच्चे को दूध पिलाया तो चुप हो गया। एक दिन उसका वीडियो कॉल करीब पांच घंटे चला। इसी दिन नाजिया के बेटे की मौत हुई थी। उस दिन बच्चा काफी देर सोया था। शहजादी बार-बार उसे उठा रही थी, लेकिन वो उठ नहीं रहा था। शाम को जब बच्चे की मां घर आई तो शहजादी ने कहा, बाबू अभी तक सो रहा है। इतना कभी नहीं सोता। ये लोग पास गए तो कुछ शक हुआ। तुरंत बच्चे को लेकर डॉक्टर के पास भागे। डॉक्टर ने बताया- बच्चा नहीं रहा। शहजादी ने अपनी मां को फोन किया और पूरी रात रोती रही। अगले दिन भी यही रोना-धोना चलता रहा। ये सबकुछ धीरे-धीरे शांत हुआ। मैंने एक दिन शहजादी से कहा, अब तो उनका घर छोड़ दो। वो कहने लगी जल्द ही घर आऊंगी। घटना के एक महीने के बाद शहजादी से बातचीत कम होने लगी। वो वीडियो कॉल भी करती, तो इधर-उधर देखती रहती थी। पांच मिनट भी बात नहीं करती थी। फिर सीधे जेल से शहजादी का फोन आया। उसने सारी कहानी बताई। कहा, बच्चे की मौत के बाद वो उजैर के बुआ-फूफा से घर आने के लिए जिद करने लगी। उन्हें बदनामी का डर था इसलिए शहजादी को भेजना नहीं चाहते थे। उन लोगों ने बच्चे का पोस्टमॉर्टम भी नहीं कराया था। बच्चे के डॉक्टर ने भी ये कहा था कि उसके जीवन में पहली बार ऐसा हुआ कि एक फोन से पोस्टमॉर्टम रोकना पड़ा। एक दिन उन लोगों ने शहजादी को मारपीट कर कुबूल कराया कि उसकी गलती से बच्चे की मौत हुई है। फिर खलीफा थाने में रिपोर्ट कराई और कोर्ट में गई तो सीधे फांसी की सजा सुना दी गई। तभी हमें ये पता चला कि वो प्लास्टिक सर्जरी कराने के लिए दुबई गई थी। जब उसने ये कहानी बताई तो मेरे पैर के नीचे से जमीन चली गई। अपनी बीमार पत्नी को लेकर उजैर के बुआ-फूफा के आगरा वाले घर गया। हम एक घंटा उस बड़ी सी कोठी के बाहर जमीन पर बैठे थे। फिर कह दिया गया कि यहां आने का कोई मतलब नहीं है। हम कई बार एम्बेसी भी गए। मगर कोई जवाब नहीं आता था। आखिर 15 फरवरी को उसे फांसी पर लटका दिया गया। ढाई साल में पहली बार विदेश मंत्रालय और एम्बेसी ने संपर्क किया। वो भी तब जब मैंने फोन मिलाकर उनसे शहजादी के बारे में पूछा। उन्होंने कहा कि रुकिए बताते हैं। ये बात 28 फरवरी की है। मैंने कई बार एम्बेसी में फोन किया तब उन्होंने कहा कि अफसोस है आपकी बेटी को नहीं बचाया जा सका। इससे पहले मैं किसके दरवाजे नहीं गया? पीएमओ से लेकर सीएम तक, मैं हर जगह गया और कहीं सुनवाई नहीं हुई। अब मैं बस यही चाहता हूं कि जिंदा रहते तो बेटी को इंसाफ नहीं मिला। कम से कम मरने के बाद तो उसे इंसाफ मिल जाए। उजैर नाम का लड़का है, वो मानव तस्कर है। मेरी बेटी ने बताया था कि उजैर ने उससे तीन लाख रुपए लिए थे और उधर अपनी बुआ से भी डेढ़ लाख रुपए लिए थे। वो मेरी बेटी के दिव्यांग सर्टिफिकेट से हर महीने 1500 रुपए लेता रहा। मैंने ये सब कम्प्लेन की है। आप चेक कर सकते हैं। मैंने आगरा में उजैर पर जुलाई 2024 का मुकदमा किया है, अभी तक ना चार्जशीट बनी है और ना ही कोई पूछने वाला है। वो पेंशन निकालता है, उसका एटीएम यूज करता है। मुझे इस बात का जिंदगी भर अफसोस रहेगा कि मेरी बेटी को बचाया जा सकता था, लेकिन किसी ने मदद नहीं की। एसपी-डीजीपी, एम्बेसी से लेकर कई बड़े अधिकारियों तक के पास मैं गया, लेकिन किसी ने नहीं सुनी। ये जज्बात शब्बीर ने भास्कर रिपोर्टर शाश्वत से साझा किए। ------------------------------------------------------ संडे जज्बात सीरीज की ये स्टोरीज भी पढ़िए... 1.संडे जज्बात- शादी कर बेटी लंदन भेजी, वहां लाश मिली:लड़का बिना देखे रिश्ता किया, हर्षिता ने कहा था- वो मुझे मार देगा मैं सुदेश कुमारी, हर्षिता ब्रेला की मां। दिल्ली के पालम में रहती हूं। आज से 94 दिन पहले 15 नवंबर 2024 को मेरी बेटी हर्षिता की लाश लंदन में एक कार में मिली। हर्षिता से आखिरी बातचीत भी 10 नवंबर को हुई थी। हम दोनों वीडियो कॉल पर थे। पूरी खबर पढ़ें... 2. संडे जज्बात-मेरे मरीज कहते हैं भूत से उनके फिजिकल रिलेशन:मुझे देखकर नजर चुराते हैं, इंसानी रिश्ते जानवरों जैसे मैं डॉ. सत्यकांत त्रिवेदी, भोपाल में साइकेट्रिक कंसल्टेंट हूं। मैंने दिल्ली के बुराड़ी में पूरे परिवार के आत्महत्या केस की जांच भी की है। मेरे पास जो केस आते हैं, वे रुह कंपा देते हैं। कुछ महीने पहले एक 13 साल की लड़की का ऐसा केस आया जिसने मेरा मानवीय रिश्तों को लेकर सोचने का तरीका बदल दिया। पूरी खबर पढ़ने के लिए क्लिक करें...",

            "description": "साल 2014 की बात है। स्पाइसजेट एयरलाइन के पास 30 विमान थे। उस वक्त लगभग 7500 कर्मचारी स्पाइसजेट में काम कर रहे थे। कंपनी इस कदर फाइनेंशियल क्राइसिस से जूझ रही थी कि सैलरी देना भी मुश्किल हो रहा था। कंपनी ने इस संकट से उबरने के लिए अपने 5 विमान बेच दिए। साथ ही कर्मचारियों की छंटनी का भी फैसला लिया। हालांकि कंपनी ने उस वक्त कितने लोगों को निकाला था ये साफ नहीं है। 10 साल बाद 2024 की तीसरी तिमाही में स्पाइसजेट को पहली बार 25 करोड़ रुपए का मुनाफा हुआ है। साल 2024 में कंपनी का रेवेन्यू 8,497 करोड़ रहा। वर्तमान में कंपनी में 9 हजार कर्मचारी है। आज मेगा एंपायर में कहानी भारत की लो कॉस्ट एयरलाइन स्पाइसजेट की 41 साल पहले 9 फरवरी, 1984 में मोदी ग्रुप ऑफ कंपनी के मालिक एसके मोदी ने एक प्राइवेट एयर टैक्सी की कंपनी शुरू की। ये कंपनी निजी इस्तेमाल के लिए छोटे एयरक्राफ्ट किराए पर देती थी। उस समय कंपनी जीनियस लीजिंग फाइनेंस एंड इन्वेस्टमेंट कंपनी लिमिटेड के नाम से रजिस्टर थी। यह प्राइवेट एयर टैक्सी कंपनी थी, इसलिए इसका किराया ज्यादा था। उस वक्त एअर इंडिया और वायुदूत एयरलाइंस जैसी कंपनियों का दबदबा था। इस वजह से मोदी ग्रुप की एयर टैक्सी कंपनी पर लोगों ने भरोसा नहीं दिखाया। कंपनी की बिगड़ती हालत को देखते हुए एसके मोदी ने इसे प्राइवेट एयर टैक्सी कंपनी से डोमेस्टिक एयरलाइन कंपनी में बदलने का फैसला किया। 17 फरवरी 1993 को कंपनी का नाम बदलकर एमजी एक्सप्रेस लिमिटेड कर दिया गया। अब कंपनी डोमेस्टिक एयरलाइन के तौर पर काम करने लगी। तब कंपनी के पास तीन बोइंग 737-200 एडवांस एयरक्राफ्ट थे। जर्मन एयरलाइन कंपनी लुफ्थांसा के साथ की तकनीकी पार्टनरशिप साल 1993 में ही एसके मोदी ने बेहतर टेक्नोलॉजी डेवलपमेंट करने के मकसद से जर्मन एयरलाइन कंपनी लुफ्थांसा के साथ पार्टनरशिप की। इस समझौते के बाद जर्मन एयरलाइन ने एमजी एक्सप्रेस कंपनी के पायलट समेत सभी कर्मचारियों को ट्रेनिंग दी। साथ ही लीज पर एमजी एक्सप्रेस को 5 एयरक्राफ्ट भी दिए। इन एयरक्राफ्ट में कंपनी ने फर्स्ट क्लास और इकोनाॅमिक क्लास सर्विस देनी शुरू की। साल 1994 तक एमजी एक्सप्रेस लिमिटेड भारत में जाना-पहचाना नाम बन चुकी थी। एसके मोदी ने स्विसएयर, केएलएम-रॉयल डच एयरलाइंस, क्वांटास एयरवेज, एयर कनाडा जैसी इंटरनेशनल एयरलाइन के साथ समझौता कर लिया। साथ ही कंपनी ने करीब ढाई करोड़ इक्विटी शेयर जारी कर दिए, जिसकी कीमत 24 करोड़ रुपए थी। 12 अप्रैल, 1994 को कंपनी का नाम एकबार फिर बदलकर मोदीलुफ्ट लिमिटेड कर दिया गया। सितंबर 1994 में, कंपनी ने एयरक्राफ्ट फ्यूल का इंतजाम करने के लिए इंडियन ऑयल कॉर्पोरेशन लिमिटेड के साथ एक समझौता साइन किया। उस वक्त मोदीलुफ्ट एकमात्र ऐसी एयरलाइन थी जिसने भारत में हर रोज कम से कम 12 घंटे एयरक्राफ्ट का इस्तेमाल किया। 23 नवंबर, 1994 में कंपनी को शेड्यूल्ड एयरलाइन (जिसकी रूट और समय पहले से तय होते हैं) का दर्जा मिला। साथ ही कंपनी को इंटरनेशनल एयर ट्रांसपोर्ट एसोसिएशन (आईएटीए) की सदस्यता भी मिल गई। साल 1995 में मोदीलुफ्ट की इंडियन पार्टनर कंपनी ने लुफ्थांसा पर समझौते के अनुसार फंड नहीं देने का आरोप लगाया। इस पर जर्मन एयरलाइन का कहना था कि मोदीलुफ्ट ने लीज पर लिए चार लुफ्थांसा विमानों की पेमेंट समय पर नहीं की। मई 1996 में दोनों कपंनी ने समझौता खत्म करने का फैसला किया। समझौता खत्म होते ही लुफ्थांसा के एयरक्राफ्ट की उड़ान भी रोक दी गई। जिसकी वजह से मोदीलुफ्ट कंपनी को काफी ज्यादा नुकसान हुआ। इस वजह से 1996 में कंपनी बंद हो गई। 5 साल बाद 2002 में एकबार फिर एयरलाइन कंपनी शुरू करने की कोशिश की गई। इस बार नाम रखा रॉयल एयरवेज लिमिटेड। हालांकि इसे शुरू करने के लिए इन्वेस्टर नहीं मिले और ये कंपनी शुरू ही नहीं हो पाई। 2004 में रॉयल एयरवेज लिमिटेड को बिजनेस टाइकून अजय सिंह ने खरीद लिया। अजय सिंह ने एयरलाइन में कम बजट वाला मॉडल अपनाते हुए कंपनी को दोबारा शुरू करने की योजना बनाई। 29 अप्रैल, 2005 को इसका नाम बदलकर स्पाइसजेट कर दिया गया। इससे पहले चार बार कंपनी का नाम बदला जा चुका था। स्पाइसजेट ने 2005 में दो बोइंग एयरक्राफ्ट 737-800 लीज पर लिए, साथ ही बोइंग और क्यू-400 कंपनी को 10 नए विमानों का ऑर्डर दिया। स्पाइसजेट की बुकिंग 18 मई 2005 को शुरू हुई और 24 मई 2005 को दिल्ली-मुंबई के बीच कंपनी की पहली फ्लाइट ने उड़ान भरी। जुलाई 2008 तक मार्केट शेयर के मामले में स्पाइसजेट कम लागत वाली भारत की तीसरी सबसे बड़ी एयरलाइन बनी। जून 2010 में अजय सिंह ने स्पाइसजेट की 37.7% हिस्सेदारी 750 करोड़ रुपए में सन ग्रुप के मालिक कलानिधि मारन को बेच दी। एयरलाइन ने जुलाई 2010 में 30 बोइंग 737-8 एयरक्राफ्ट और दिसंबर 2010 में 15 बॉम्बार्डियर Q4 डैश शॉर्ट-हॉल एयरक्राफ्ट खरीदे। इससे कंपनी की परफॉर्मेंस काफी बेहतर हो गई। साल 2012 में कच्चे तेल की कीमत बढ़ गई। इस वजह से स्पाइसजेट को 39 करोड़ रुपए से अधिक का नुकसान हो गया। 2014 तक कंपनी की हालत काफी खराब हो गई। बिगड़ते टाइमिंग और खराब कनेक्टिविटी जैसी कई वजहों से लोगो ने स्पाइसजेट में ट्रैवल करना बंद कर दिया। कंपनी पर करीब 1500 करोड़ का कर्ज हो गया। नतीजतन 2014 के आखिर तक कंपनी दिवालिया होने के कगार पर थी। दिसंबर 2014 में अजय सिंह ने केंद्र सरकार से बातचीत कर एक टेम्परेरी एग्रीमेंट साइन किया। इसके अनुसार कंपनी किश्तों में अपना कर्ज चुका सकती थी। इसके बाद कंपनी को रिस्ट्रक्चर करने के लिए अजय सिंह ने जनवरी 2015 में सन ग्रुप से अपने शेयर वापस ले लिए। इस समय सबसे बड़ी समस्या कस्टमर और इन्वेस्टर का भरोसा वापस पाना था। कस्टमर टिकट बुक नहीं कर रहे थे, पार्टनर विमान वापस मांग रहे थे और सरकार कर्ज चुकाने के लिए एयरलाइन के पीछे पड़ी थी। पैसेंजर को परेशानी हो रही थी और कर्मचारियों को लगा कि उनका कोई भविष्य नहीं है। अजय सिंह ने जैसे-तैसे अपने कर्मचारियों को काम करने के लिए रोका। कंपनी संभालने के लिए अजय सिंह ने एयरलाइन की बेसिक जैसे फ्लाइट टाइम मैनेजमेंट ठीक करना, वेबसाइट के इंटरफेस में सुधार और एयरपोर्ट पर सुविधाएं देने जैसे काम पर फोकस किया। इसके साथ ही कम लोड वाली पैसेंजर फ्लाइट बंद कर, इंटरनेशनल डेस्टिनेशन के लिए फ्लाइट ऑपरेट करना शुरू कर दिया। इस साल कंपनी को 238 करोड़ का फायदा हुआ। सितंबर 2017 में एयरलाइन ने 25 नए एयरक्राफ्ट क्यू400 टर्बोप्रॉप एयरक्राफ्ट खरीदे। 2019 में स्पाइसजेट ने जेट एयरवेज के ग्राउंड किए गए 30 एयरक्राफ्ट भी खरीद लिए। साल 2020 में कंपनी का रेवेन्यू 12 हजार करोड़ से ज्यादा रहा। कंपनी के शानदार परफॉर्मेंस के बीच कोविड ने दस्तक दिया। जिससे स्पाइसजेट को अपनी कई फ्लाइट कैंसिल करनी पड़ी। साल 2021 में कंपनी को लगभग 7 हजार करोड़ का नुकसान झेलना पड़ा। इसके अलावा स्पाइसजेट के क्राफ्ट में खराबी के मामले भी सामने आने लगे। जिसके कारण मई 2022 में, डायरेक्टर जनरल ऑफ सिविल एविएशन (DGCA) ने कंपनी के विमान की सुरक्षा जांच शुरू की। जुलाई 2022 में, DGCA ने मौजूदा उड़ानों की 50% तक की उड़ानों पर रोक लगा दिया। कंपनी की हालत को सुधारने के लिए 12 सितंबर 2024 को स्पाइसजेट ने फाइनेंशियल क्राइसिस से निपटने के लिए ₹ ​​3,000 करोड़ का फंड जुटाने की पहल की। वर्तमान में मार्केट शेयर के आधार पर स्पाइसजेट भारत की चौथी सबसे बड़ी डोमेस्टिक एयरलाइन कंपनी है। अब कंपनी के पास कुल 65 एयरक्राफ्ट हैं। कंपनी 38 डोमेस्टिक डेस्टिनेशन और 3 इंटरनेशनल डेस्टिनेशन ( सऊदी अरब, थाइलैंड, यूनाइटेड अरब अमीरात) के लिए लगभग 147 डेली फ्लाइट ऑपरेट करती है। पैसेंजर फ्लाइट के अलावा स्पाइसएक्सप्रेस नाम से कंपनी कार्गो सप्लाई का भी काम करती है। स्पाइसएक्सप्रेस के पास भारत में 11,262 पोस्टल कोड उपलब्ध हैं।

            "description": "अमेरिका के राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रम्प का कहना है कि भारत अब अपने टैरिफ में बहुत कटौती करने को तैयार है, क्योंकि कोई उनके कारनामों की पोल खोल रहा है। ट्रम्प लगातार 100% टैरिफ लगाने के लिए भारत का नाम उछालते रहे हैं। आखिर ये टैरिफ होता क्या है, क्या ट्रम्प के दबाव में भारत सच में इसे घटाने को तैयार हो गया और इसका देश की इकोनॉमी और आम लोगों पर क्या असर पड़ेगा; जानेंगे आज के एक्सप्लेनर में... सवाल-1: डोनाल्ड ट्रम्प ने भारत के टैरिफ कटौती को लेकर क्या नया दावा किया है? जवाब: 7 मार्च 2025 को डोनाल्ड ट्रम्प ने ओवल ऑफिस में प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस के दौरान दावा किया कि भारत टैरिफ घटाने के लिए तैयार हो गया। ट्रम्प ने कहा, 'भारत हमसे बहुत ज्यादा टैरिफ वसूलता है। आप भारत में कुछ भी नहीं बेच सकते। हालांकि भारत अब अपने टैरिफ में बहुत कटौती करना चाहता है, क्योंकि कोई (अमेरिका) उनके किए की पोल खोल रहा है।' ट्रम्प ने मीडिया ब्रीफिंग में कहा, 'हमारे देश को हर किसी ने लूटा, लेकिन अब यह बंद हो गया है। मैंने अपने पहले कार्यकाल में इसे बंद करवाया था। अब हम इसे पूरी तरह से बंद करने जा रहे हैं, क्योंकि यह बहुत गलत है। अमेरिका को आर्थिक दृष्टिकोण से, वित्तीय दृष्टिकोण से और व्यापारिक दृष्टिकोण से दुनिया के लगभग हर देश ने लूटा है।' इससे पहले 6 मार्च को ट्रम्प ने कहा था कि, अमेरिका 2 अप्रैल से भारत पर 'आंख के बदले आंख' की तर्ज पर रेसिप्रोकल टैरिफ लगाएगा। इसका मतलब यह कि भारत जितना टैरिफ अमेरिकी कंपनियों से आने वाले सामान पर लगाएगा, अमेरिका भी उतना ही टैरिफ भारतीय कंपनियों के अमेरिका जाने वाले सामान पर लगाएगा। सवाल-2: क्या भारत सरकार अमेरिकी सामानों पर टैरिफ घटाने के लिए सच में राजी हो गई है? जवाब: ट्रम्प के टैरिफ घटाने के दावे पर अभी तक भारत सरकार ने कोई आधिकारिक बयान नहीं दिया है। हालांकि इस बयान पर कोई खंडन भी नहीं आया है। 7 मार्च को विदेश मंत्रालय ने कहा कि भारत, अमेरिका के साथ टैरिफ और गैर-टैरिफ बाधाओं को कम करने पर विचार कर रहा है। विदेश मंत्रालय के प्रवक्ता रणधीर जायसवाल के मुताबिक, ‘केंद्रीय वाणिज्य मंत्री पीयूष गोयल अमेरिका यात्रा पर गए हुए हैं, जहां भारत-अमेरिका के समझौतों को आगे बढ़ाने को लेकर चर्चा करेंगे।' एक्सपर्ट्स का मानना है कि भारत और अमेरिका के बीच टैरिफ घटाने को लेकर चर्चा हुई है, तभी ट्रम्प ने ऐसा बयान दिया है। इससे पहले भी ट्रम्प के दबाव में भारत ने अमेरिकी सामानों पर टैरिफ घटाने के संकेत देने शुरू कर दिए थे। जैसे... सवाल-3: टैरिफ आखिर होता क्या है और कैसे काम करता है? जवाब: टैरिफ एक तरह का बॉर्डर फीस या टैक्स होता है, जो कोई भी देश विदेशों से अपने यहां आने वाले सामान पर लगाता है। इसे घटा-बढ़ाकर ही देश आपस में व्यापार को कंट्रोल करते हैं। मान लीजिए भारत में तैयार एक डायमंड अमेरिका में 10 लाख रुपए में बिकता है। अगर ट्रम्प ने भारत पर 50% टैरिफ लगा दिया तो उस डायमंड की कीमत सीधे 15 लाख रुपए हो जाएगी। दाम बढ़ने से अमेरिका में भारत के डायमंड की खपत कम हो जाएगी। कोई देश टैरिफ बढ़ाता है तो उसके घरेलू मार्केट में विदेशी सामान महंगे हो जाते हैं। इससे सरकार की कमाई भी बढ़ती है। साथ ही विदेशी सामान की खपत कम होती है और घरेलू कंपनियों के सामान की खपत बढ़ती है। इस तरह सरकार घरेलू प्रोडक्शन को बढ़ावा देती है। उदाहरण के तौर पर चीन की कंपनियां मोबाइल फोन बनाती हैं। यह कंपनी अपने फोन अमेरिका बेचने पहुंचती है, लेकिन अमेरिका में भी बहुत सारी कंपनियां फोन बनाती हैं। अगर चीनी कंपनी वहां अपने सस्ते और आकर्षक फोन बेचना शुरू कर दे तो अमेरिकी कंपनियों को नुकसान होगा। इसके साथ ही सरकार के रेवेन्यू पर भी असर पड़ेगा। ऐसे में रेवेन्यू हासिल करने और घरेलू कंपनियों को बचाने के लिए सरकार चीनी मोबाइल कंपनियों पर टैरिफ लगाएगी। इससे चीनी फोन महंगे हो जाएंगे और फोन बनाने वाली अमेरिकी कंपनियां उनका मुकाबला कर पाएंगीं। कोई देश एकतरफा टैरिफ न बढ़ा दे, इसके लिए सभी देश विश्व व्यापार संगठन के साथ बातचीत करके एक रेट तय करते हैं। सवाल-4: ये रेसिप्रोकल टैरिफ क्या है, जिसकी धमकी ट्रम्प लगातार दे रहे हैं? जवाबः ट्रम्प ने घोषणा की है कि दोस्त हो या दुश्मन, सब पर रेसिप्रोकल टैरिफ लगाएंगे। रेसिप्रोकल यानी तराजू के दोनों पलड़े को बराबर कर देना। आसान भाषा में समझें तो अगर पलड़े के एक तरफ 1 किग्रा भार है, तो दूसरी तरफ भी 1 किग्रा वजन रखकर बराबर कर देना। यानी जितना टैरिफ दूसरे देश अमेरिका से आयात किए उत्पादों पर लगाते हैं, उतना ही अमेरिका अब उन देशों से आयात किए सामान पर लगाएगा। अगर भारत अमेरिका के जूतों पर 26.1% टैरिफ लगाता है तो अमेरिका भी भारत से आयात जूतों पर इतना ही टैरिफ लगाएगा। JNU के रिटायर्ड प्रोफेसर अरुण कुमार कहते हैं, ‘वर्ल्ड ट्रेड ऑर्गनाइजेशन यानी WTO ने कम विकसित देशों को यह छूट दी थी कि वह ज्यादा विकसित देशों पर ज्यादा टैरिफ लगा सकते हैं, जिससे उनके देश के गरीब लोगों को नुकसान न पहुंचे, लेकिन डोनाल्ड ट्रम्प ने WTO के आदेश को मानने से इनकार कर दिया। ट्रम्प यहां अपनी मर्जी चलाकर टैरिफ रेट तय करना चाहते हैं।’ सवाल-5: अगर भारत अमेरिकी सामानों पर टैरिफ कम करता है, तो आम आदमी पर क्या असर पड़ेगा? जवाब: JNU के रिटायर्ड प्रोफेसर और अर्थशास्त्री अरुण कुमार के मुताबिक, 'अगर भारत ने टैरिफ कम कर दिया तो इसका सीधा असर किसान, गरीब मजदूर और असंगठित क्षेत्रों पर पड़ेगा। टैरिफ कम करने से विदेशी चीजें सस्ती हो जाएंगी और भारत में निर्मित होने वाले सामान की पूछ-परख खत्म हो जाएगी।' उदाहरण से समझें तो भारत का किसान सेब उगाता है, जिसे वो बाजार में बेच कर पैसा कमाता है। अगर कम टैरिफ की वजह से अमेरिका भी भारत में सेब बेचने लगा तो मार्केट में घरेलू सेब को चुनौती मिलने लगेगी। लोग कम कीमत पर विदेशी सेब खरीदने लगेंगे। इससे सेब खरीदने और खाने वाली मिडिल क्लास को तो फायदा होगा, लेकिन सेब उत्पादक और बेचने वाले किसान को नुकसान होगा। अरुण कुमार ने कहा, भारत सरकार जितना टैरिफ कम करेगी उतना ही आम आदमी को नुकसान होगा। इससे बेरोजगारी बढ़ेगी और नौकरियां खत्म हो जाएंगी। भारत में इम्पोर्ट बढ़ने का मतलब प्रोडक्शन कम होना। इससे गरीबों की संख्या में बढ़ोतरी होगी और अमीरों को फायदा होता रहेगा। सवाल-6: अगर भारत अमेरिकी सामानों पर टैरिफ कम करता है, तो इकोनॉमी पर क्या इम्पैक्ट पड़ेगा? जवाब: विदेश मामलों के जानकार और जेएनयू के प्रोफेसर राजन कुमार का कहना है, ‘भारत और अमेरिका के बीच करीब 42 बिलियन डॉलर यानी करीब 3.6 लाख करोड़ रुपए का ट्रेड होता है। ऐसे में अगर भारत टैरिफ कम कर भी देता है, तो इससे देश की इकोनॉमी पर ज्यादा असर नहीं पड़ेगा। दोनों देशों के बीच 35 लाख करोड़ रुपए को लेकर ही समझौता है। केंद्रीय मंत्री पीयूष गोयल टैरिफ पर चर्चा करने के लिए अमेरिका गए हैं, इसलिए इस मसले पर खुलकर कुछ भी नहीं कहा जा सकता है।’ वहीं, ग्लोबल फाइनेंशियल ग्रुप नोमुरा की एक रिपोर्ट के अनुसार, अमेरिका के रेसिप्रोकल टैरिफ से बचने के लिए भारत 30 से अधिक वस्तुओं पर टैरिफ कम कर सकता है। इससे अमेरिकी सामान भारत में सस्ता हो सकता है। इसके अलावा अमेरिकी रक्षा और ऊर्जा उत्पादों की अपनी खरीद बढ़ा सकता है। अमेरिका ने 2024 में भारत को 42 बिलियन डॉलर (करीब 3.6 लाख करोड़ रुपए) का सामान बेचा है। इसमें भारत सरकार ने लकड़ी के उत्पादों और मशीनरी पर 7%, फुटवियर और ट्रांसपोर्ट इक्विपमेंट्स पर 15% से 20% तक और फूड प्रोडक्ट्स पर 68% तक टैरिफ वसूला है। अमेरिका का कृषि उत्पादों पर टैरिफ भारत के 39% की तुलना में 5% है। बजट 2025 में, सरकार ने इलेक्ट्रॉनिक्स, कपड़ा और हाई-एंड मोटरसाइकिल समेत कई उत्पादों पर आयात शुल्क कम कर दिया था। अब, भारत ट्रेड रिलेशन्स को पहले की तरह बनाए रखने के लिए लग्जरी व्हीकल्स, सोलर सेल्स और केमिकल्स पर टैरिफ में और कटौती पर विचार कर रहा है। टैरिफ घटाने से भारत की अर्थव्यवस्था पर 4 बड़े इम्पैक्ट होंगे... 1. भारतीय कंपनियों का कॉम्पिटिशन बढ़ेगा: अमेरिका पर टैरिफ घटाने से इलेक्ट्रॉनिक्स उत्पादों का इम्पोर्ट बढ़ेगा। भारतीय कंपनियों के मुकाबले विदेशी ब्रांड्स को बढ़त मिलेगी। इसके अलावा भारतीय ऑटोमोबाइल मैन्युफैक्चरिंग कंपनियों को भी नुकसान हो सकता है। 2. इम्पोर्ट बढ़ सकता है: अगर भारत अमेरिकी सामानों पर टैरिफ घटाता है, तो अमेरिकी चीजें भारतीय बाजार में सस्ती हो जाएंगी। इससे इन सामानों का इंपोर्ट बढ़ सकता है। 3. रुपया कमजोर हो सकता है: ज्यादा इम्पोर्ट का मतलब डॉलर की ज्यादा डिमांड। इससे रुपया कमजोर होगा और भारत का इम्पोर्ट बिल बढ़ जाएगा। इसका मतलब अब अमेरिका से सामान खरीदने के लिए ज्यादा पैसे चुकाने होंगे। 4. विदेशी निवेश घटेगा: अगर भारत टैरिफ कम करता है, तो अमेरिकी कंपनियां हाई टैरिफ से बचने के लिए भारत में अपने प्रोडक्शन पर जोर नहीं देंगी। इससे फॉरेन डायरेक्ट इन्वेस्टमेंट यानी FDI घटेगा। सवाल-7: अगर भारत ने टैरिफ में कटौती नहीं की और अमेरिका ने रेसिप्रोकल टैरिफ लगा दिया, तो भारत पर क्या असर होगा? जवाबः इससे भारत पर 4 बड़े असर हो सकते हैं... वित्त मंत्री निर्मला सीतारमण ने भी विशाखापट्‌टनम में एक कार्यक्रम में बताया कि 'अभी देखना होगा कि अमेरिका के साथ बातचीत का क्या हल निकलता है।' ---------- ट्रम्प और टैरिफ से जुड़ी अन्य खबरें... 'आंख के बदले आंख' की तर्ज पर टैरिफ लगाएंगे ट्रम्प:भारत को हर साल ₹61 हजार करोड़ का नुकसान, अमेरिकी सामान सस्ते हो सकते हैं अमेरिका 2 अप्रैल से भारत पर 'आंख के बदले आंख' की तर्ज पर रेसिप्रोकल टैरिफ लगाएगा। इसका मतलब यह कि भारत जितना टैरिफ अमेरिकी कंपनियों से आने वाले सामान पर लगाएगा, अमेरिका भी उतना ही टैरिफ भारतीय कंपनियों के अमेरिका जाने वाले सामान पर लगाएगा। अमेरिका के इस फैसले से भारत पर क्या असर होगा? क्या अमेरिकी सामान सस्ता हो जाएगा? अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति ऐसा क्यों कर रहे हैं। पढ़िए पूरी खबर...",

These measures, viewed by some as acts of retribution, may infringe on First Amendment speech protections and Fifth Amendment due process rights, an unsettling precedent according to critics.Trump's directives limit access to federal buildings for Perkins Coie attorneys, questioning their security clearances. The orders challenge their government contracts, touching on serious allegations of racial discrimination. Meanwhile, Covington faces sanctions over its association with Special Counsel Jack Smith, who initiated criminal proceedings against Trump.Trump's actions have faced significant backlash from the legal community, raising concerns about viewpoint discrimination and government interference. As legal scholars prepare for potential challenges, the struggle underscores the volatile intersection of politics and law in this unprecedented standoff.",
