            "description": "PM Modi Trump Meeting Live: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday, marking their first meeting since Trump took office. Trade, tariffs, and defence cooperation will be key topics as both leaders seek to strengthen U.S.-India ties. Modi is expected to offer trade concessions, including lower tariffs on American goods and increased imports of U.S. energy and defence equipment, in an effort to ease trade tensions. The Trump administration has pushed for more reciprocal trade policies, citing concerns over India’s high import duties. Beyond trade, discussions will cover defence procurement, immigration policies, and India’s strategic role in countering China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific. With Modi’s visit shaping the future of U.S.-India relations, the outcome could have significant implications for trade, security, and global diplomacy. Stay tuned to our live blog for real-time updates on the meeting.",

To prevent disproportionate taxation on those earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh, the government has introduced marginal relief, significantly reducing tax burdens for middle-income earners.

'डेडपूल 2' में भी शाहरुख खान की लोकप्रियता का आलम देखने को मिला. निर्देशक डेविड लीच ने 'डेडपूल 2' के हिंदी वर्जन को पूरी तरह भारतीय स्टाइल देने की कोशिश की और हिंदी फैंस से जोड़ने के लिए फिल्म में शाहरुख खान की फिल्म 'स्वदेश' का गाना 'यूं ही चला चल' भी शामिल किया गया.वहीं अब एंथनी मैकी के इस बयान के बाद सोशल मीडिया पर चर्चाओं का बाजार गर्म है कि शायद मार्वल और शाहरुख खान के बीच किसी प्रोजेक्ट को लेकर बातचीत चल रही है. अब देखनेवाली बात होगी कि क्या 'कैप्टन अमेरिका' एंथनी मैकी की शाहरुख खान को एवेंजर्स में शामिल करने की ये इच्छा पूरी होगी.वर्कफ्रंट की बात करें तो शाहरुख खान इन दिनों अपनी आने वाली फिल्म किंग की तैयारियों में लगे हुए हैं. किंग को सिद्धार्थ आनंद डायरेक्ट कर रहे हैं. इस फिल्म में शाहरुख खान के साथ सुहाना खान अहम किरदार निभाती नजर आएंगी.ये भी पढ़ें: TV TRP Report: ‘अनुपमा’ ने मारी बाजी, ‘सेलिब्रिटी मास्टर शेफ’ को लगा तगड़ा झटका, देखें टॉप शोज की टीआरपी रिपोर्ट",

The company will list the division in Amsterdam, London, and New York, a decision that signals a significant change in strategy.The move comes as part of Unilever's efforts to regain investor confidence after years of lackluster performance in its ice cream sector. The company had revealed these plans last year, emphasizing the need to streamline operations and focus on more profitable ventures.By making its ice cream business an independent entity, Unilever aims to unlock value and propel growth. This strategic step is expected to provide the necessary boost to rejuvenate investor interest and enhance the company's overall market standing.",

            "description": "The recent proceedings in the Rajya Sabha saw intense discussions regarding the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) report on the Waqf Amendment Bill 2024. The report, which was presented to the house, ignited strong reactions from the opposition, leading to a significant disruption of the proceedings. As a result, the session had to be adjourned until 11:20 AM due to the uproar. The report outlined the findings and deliberations on the bill, a matter of considerable importance in the current political landscape. However, the opposition expressed its discontent, citing issues related to the management of Waqf properties, land allocation, and the lack of adequate health centers and educational institutions for the Muslim community. Many felt that these resources should be prioritized for the marginalized sections of society, particularly underprivileged Muslims who could benefit from more accessible public services. Despite the tension, the government remained firm on its stance regarding the bill and its associated amendments. The ongoing debate underscores the deep divisions within the house and the challenges in reaching a consensus on crucial national policies, particularly concerning religious and minority welfare.",

            "description": "India's Fielding Frenzy Shines in ODI Series Against England Fielding excellence was on full display as India completed a clean sweep against England in their recent ODI series. T Dilip, the Indian fielding coach, expressed immense satisfaction over the team's remarkable performances, which included phenomenal catches and strategic run-outs.The highlight of the series was Shreyas Iyer's exceptional fielding, earning him the prestigious 'Impact Fielder' medal. Iyer's decisive run-out of England's Phil Salt in the first match was a turning point that underscored India's robust fielding strategy under Dilip's guidance.According to Dilip, the fielding efforts were consistently superior, with players like Harshit Rana and Shubman Gill making critical contributions. These outstanding feats helped India secure a 142-run victory and were a testament to the team's composure and fielding prowess throughout the series.",

            "description": "केंद्र सरकार ने बुधवार (12 फरवरी, 2025) को सुप्रीम कोर्ट को सूचित किया कि उसने हाल में एकीकृत पेंशन योजना (UPS) को अधिसूचित किया है, जिससे न्यायिक अधिकारियों की चिंताओं का समाधान हो सकता है. जस्टिस भूषण रामाकृष्ण गवई और जस्टिस ऑगस्टीन जॉर्ज मसीह की पीठ ने केंद्र के वकील की दलीलें सुनीं.एकीकृत पेंशन योजना नियोक्ता-आधारित पेंशन योजना है जिसमें सामाजिक सुरक्षा को कर्मचारियों के कुल लाभ के हिस्से के रूप में गिना जाता है. केंद्र की ओर से अटॉर्नी जनरल आर. वेंकटरमणी और सॉलिसिटर जनरल तुषार मेहता पेश हुए और पीठ को एकीकृत पेंशन योजना के बारे में जानकारी दी.यह मामला जिला न्यायपालिका के अधिकारियों के लिए नयी पेंशन योजना की प्रयोज्यता से संबंधित है. पीठ ने कहा, 'अटॉर्नी जनरल और सॉलिसिटर जनरल का कहना है कि एकीकृत पेंशन योजना न्यायिक अधिकारियों समेत सभी कर्मचारियों की चिंताओं का समाधान कर सकती है.'कोर्ट ने कहा कि इसलिए न्यायालय ने यह उचित समझा कि मामले को कुछ समय के लिए स्थगित कर दिया जाए ताकि यह देखा जा सके कि एकीकृत पेंशन योजना किस प्रकार काम करती है और फिर संबंधित मुद्दों पर निर्णय लिया जा सके. मामले की सुनवाई 12 सप्ताह बाद होगी.यह मामला जिला न्यायपालिका के अधिकारियों और हाईकोर्ट के रिटायर्ड को पेंशन के वितरण पर चिंता को लेकर है. सुप्रीम कोर्ट जिला न्यायपालिका के अधिकारियों के वेतन, बकाया और भत्तों से संबंधित मामले पर विचार कर रहा है. वित्त मंत्रालय ने 25 जनवरी को यूपीएस को अधिसूचित किया था और इसमें सेवानिवृत्ति से पहले अंतिम 12 महीनों के दौरान प्राप्त औसत मूल वेतन के 50 पर्सेंट के बराबर पेंशन सुनिश्चित करने का वादा किया गया है.वित्त मंत्रालय की ओर से जारी राजपत्र अधिसूचना के अनुसार यूपीएस उन केंद्रीय सरकारी कर्मचारियों पर लागू होगा जो राष्ट्रीय पेंशन प्रणाली (NPS) के अंतर्गत आते हैं और इस प्रणाली के तहत विकल्प चुनते हैं. 25 जनवरी को प्रकाशित अधिसूचना के अनुसार कर्मचारी के सेवा से हटाये जाने या बर्खास्त किये जाने या त्यागपत्र दिये जाने की स्थिति में यूपीएस या सुनिश्चित भुगतान उपलब्ध नहीं होगा.अधिसूचना 23 लाख सरकारी कर्मचारियों को यूपीएस और एनपीएस के बीच चयन करने का विकल्प प्रदान करती है. एनपीएस को एक जनवरी 2004 को लागू किया गया था. यह भी पढ़ें:-Pappu Yadav: 'ये बाबा लोग एक दिन खाना खिलाकर टैक्स में बच...', साधू-संतों को टैक्स छूट पर क्या-क्या बोल गए पप्पू यादव",

Net income increased 45.8% on-year to KRW142.4 billion. In the fourth quarter alone, the company recorded KRW98.2 billion in net sales, KRW46.6 billion in operating profit, and KRW40.7 billion in net income, reflecting year-over-year growth of 10.4%, 26.7%, and 130%, respectively. NET SALES GROWTH DRIVEN BY TOXIN, HA FILLERS, COSMETICS Hugel's botulinum toxin, branded as Botulax in South Korea and globally known as Letybo, achieved KRW203.2 billion in net sales in 2024 with a 20.2% increase on-year. The overseas sales of the botulinum toxin rose 39.6% on-year, fueled by strong performance in major Asia-Pacific markets, shipment to the US, and robust growth in Europe. Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers, branded as THE CHAEUM and BYRYZN in South Korea and globally known as Revolax, achieved KRW127.6 billion in net sales for 2024. The overseas sales of dermal fillers rose 13.2% on-year, led by steady shipments to China and continued growth in Europe and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Hugel focuses on marketing activities for the fillers to increase brand awareness while maintaining leadership in South Korea and expanding its presence in global markets. Hugel's cosmetics business, represented by brands WELLAGE and BYRYZN BR, showed rapid growth last year. Net sales of the cosmetics business jumped 37.8% on-year to KRW36.9 billion in 2024. In the fourth quarter, net sales soared 48.1% on-year to KRW11.7 billion. Hugel is strengthening the cosmetics brand value by releasing the Hyper Peptide series of WELLAGE last August and promoting BYRYZN BR, launched in April 2024. GLOBAL EXPANSION ACCELERATES WITH TOXIN ENTRY IN THE US, MENA, AND OTHER EMERGING MARKETS Hugel will continue to focus on expanding sales and increasing market dominance abroad this year. The company is prioritizing sales and marketing efforts in the US, where it plans to officially launch its botulinum toxin in the first half of the year. Hugel aims to capture 10% of the US medical aesthetics market within three years, differentiating itself through academic events for medical professionals and competitive pricing strategies. Hugel will also accelerate its expansion in MENA, a key emerging market for medical aesthetics. The company targets a 30% share within three years in major markets, including the United Arab Emirates where it obtained a marketing license in January of this year and Kuwait where it has been present for 2.5 years. \"We achieved the highest net sales, operating profit, and net income in 2024 since our inception with significant growth in flagship products such as botulinum toxin and hyaluronic acid fillers and new growth driver cosmetics. We will continue expansion in our new markets, including North America and MENA, while strengthening our leadership position in Asia-Pacific and Europe and solidifying our position as a global industry leader\", a Hugel official said.

            "description": "गाजियाबाद में साप्ताहिक बाजार विवाद को सुलझाने के लिए आज नगर निगम में महत्वपूर्ण बैठक होगी। नगर निगम के सर्वे के अनुसार, वर्तमान में शहर में 65 स्थानों पर साप्ताहिक बाजार लगता है। इनमें वसुंधरा जोन में 24, कवि नगर जोन में 15, मोहन नगर जोन में 8, विजयनगर में 7 और सिटी जोन में 11 बाजार शामिल हैं। बाजार हटाने के विरोध में भाजपा विधायक किशोर गुर्जर ने कड़ा रुख अपनाया था और इसे 2 लाख लोगों की आजीविका से जोड़ा था। मामले की गंभीरता को देखते हुए उत्तर प्रदेश के मुख्य सचिव मनोज सिंह को भी हस्तक्षेप करना पड़ा, जिन्होंने स्पष्ट किया कि नए स्थान चिह्नित होने तक पुराने स्थानों पर ही बाजार लगेंगे। वर्तमान में सड़कों पर लगने वाले इन बाजारों से यातायात जाम की समस्या के साथ-साथ मेडिकल इमरजेंसी में भी दिक्कतें आ रही हैं। आज की बैठक में टाउन वेंडिंग कमेटी का पुनर्गठन भी किया जाएगा और बाजार व्यवस्था को लेकर विस्तृत चर्चा की जाएगी।",

            "description": "ग्रीन वेजिटेबल्स, नट्स, फ्रेश फ्रूट्स और हेल्दी फैट्स से भरपूर डाइट लें। ओमेगा-3 फैटी एसिड्स (अखरोट, अलसी, चिया सीड्स) स्किन के लिए फायदेमंद होते हैं। दिनभर में 8-10 गिलास पानी पीने से टॉक्सिन्स बाहर निकलते हैं और स्किन हेल्दी बनी रहती है। योग, मेडिटेशन और एक्सरसाइज से स्ट्रेस लेवल कंट्रोल में रहता है, जिससे हार्मोन बैलेंस होते हैं। स्किन टाइप के अनुसार क्लींजिंग, मॉइश्चराइजिंग और सनस्क्रीन का इस्तेमाल करें। हार्ड केमिकल वाले प्रोडक्ट्स से बचें। अगर हार्मोनल इम्बैलेंस के कारण स्किन प्रॉब्लम्स बढ़ रही हैं, तो एंडोक्राइनोलॉजिस्ट या डर्मेटोलॉजिस्ट से संपर्क करें। अगर सही लाइफस्टाइल और स्किन केयर फॉलो किया जाए, तो हार्मोनल इम्बैलेंस के कारण होने वाली स्किन समस्याओं को कंट्रोल किया जा सकता है। भास्कर न्यूज| लुधियाना। हार्मोनल इम्बैलेंस सिर्फ हेल्थ को ही नहीं, बल्कि आपकी स्किन को भी प्रभावित करता है। हार्मोन्स में बदलाव के कारण चेहरे पर एक्ने, पिगमेंटेशन, ड्राइनेस, ऑयली स्किन और प्रीमेच्योर एजिंग जैसी समस्याएं देखने को मिलती हैं। खासतौर पर युवाओं, महिलाओं और मिडिल एज ग्रुप के लोगों में यह परेशानी ज्यादा देखने को मिलती है। पीसीओएस, थायरॉइड, स्ट्रेस, खराब लाइफस्टाइल इसके मुख्य कारण हैं। शहर के एक प्रमुख स्किन एक्सपर्ट के मुताबिक जब शरीर में एस्ट्रोजन, प्रोजेस्टेरोन, टेस्टोस्टेरोन या कॉर्टिसोल जैसे हार्मोन्स असंतुलित होते हैं, तो स्किन की ऑयल प्रोडक्शन, इलास्टिसिटी और टेक्सचर पर असर पड़ता है। कुछ लोगों को अचानक से चेहरे पर पिंपल्स की समस्या होती है, तो कुछ को त्वचा का रूखापन या रेडनेस झेलनी पड़ती है। वहीं, कुछ महिलाओं को मेनोपॉज के दौरान स्किन टोन और टेक्सचर में बड़े बदलाव नजर आते हैं। अगर सही खानपान, स्किन केयर और लाइफस्टाइल में बैलेंस रखा जाए, तो हार्मोनल इम्बैलेंस के कारण होने वाली स्किन प्रॉब्लम्स से राहत पाई जा सकती है। हार्मोनल बदलावों से स्किन सबसे ज्यादा प्रभावित होती है। टेस्टोस्टेरोन बढ़ने से ऑयली स्किन और एक्ने की समस्या होती है, जबकि एस्ट्रोजन लेवल घटने से ड्राइनेस और एजिंग साइन्स दिखते हैं। सही स्किन केयर रूटीन अपनाना बेहद जरूरी है। ऑयली स्किन वालों को सैलिसिलिक एसिड बेस्ड क्लींजर इस्तेमाल करना चाहिए, जबकि ड्राई स्किन के लिए हाइलूरोनिक एसिड और सेरामाइड्स युक्त मॉइश्चराइजर फायदेमंद रहेगा। साथ ही, हार्मोन बैलेंस करने के लिए पर्याप्त नींद, हाइड्रेशन और सही डाइट लेना जरूरी है। हार्मोनल इम्बैलेंस का स्किन पर असर तभी कम होगा जब हम अंदरूनी कारणों को भी समझें। पीसीओएस, थायरॉइड, स्ट्रेस और इंसुलिन रेजिस्टेंस स्किन प्रॉब्लम्स को बढ़ाते हैं। खाने में फाइबर और एंटीऑक्सीडेंट्स से भरपूर फूड्स शामिल करें। अत्यधिक प्रोसेस्ड फूड, कैफीन और शुगर से बचें, क्योंकि ये हार्मोन को और असंतुलित कर सकते हैं।",

            "description": "Naming Tensions: Gulf of Mexico vs. Gulf of America The White House escalated its longstanding tensions with news organizations by demanding the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, a move pushed by President Donald Trump. The Associated Press (AP) refused to comply, citing geographical accuracy and precedent.As a response, AP journalists found themselves barred from White House events, a retaliatory act described by many media advocates as an affront to press freedom enshrined in the First Amendment. Despite the White House's insistence that the new designation is factual, the AP and other major outlets remain committed to using 'Gulf of Mexico.'International media groups and freedom of speech advocates have condemned the White House's actions as censorious and intimidating. This situation underscores the ever-present tension between governmental authority and independent journalism in shaping public discourse.",

Modi's meeting at the White House comes as New Delhi seeks to strengthen ties with Washington, and avoid tariffs. The 74-year-old recently concluded his three-day visit to France. He co-chaired the AI Action Summit with French President Emmanuel Macron.Modi 'Looking Forward' To Meeting Trump\"I look forward to meeting my friend, President Trump...have a very warm recollection of working together in his first term in building a Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership between India and the US. This visit will be an opportunity to build upon the successes of our collaboration in his first term and develop an agenda to further elevate and deepen our partnership, including in the areas of technology, trade, defence, energy, and supply chain resilience. We will work together for the mutual benefit of the people of our two countries and shape a better future for the world,\" the Indian PM said in his departure statement.PM Modi is expected to focus on trade, strategic defence cooperation and global security challenges during his meeting with Donald Trump. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said that the Indian Prime Minister's visit 'shows the importance of the India-US partnership and is also reflective of the bipartisan support that this partnership enjoys in the United States'.",

His primary goal is to eliminate the drug's movement into the United States entirely.This decisive move follows U.S. president Donald Trump's tariff threats linked to illegal imports. Brosseau, drawing from his extensive experience in law enforcement, aims to unify efforts across different levels of government agencies.Speaking at a border facility, Brosseau emphasized the importance of cross-border collaborations, asserting that a united approach is essential to combat this crisis. Canada has pledged CDN$1.3 billion in increased border security measures, signaling a serious commitment to the issue.",

These cases involve allegations of retaining classified documents, subverting the 2020 election, and financial cover-ups.Blanche, emphasizing his commitment to ethical guidelines, stated he would consult with career ethics officials if confirmed. The backdrop includes recent dismissals of ethics officials under Trump's administration, raising alarms about politically-driven prosecutions.",

            "description": "BEIJING, Feb. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The 15th day of the first month on the Chinese lunar calendar marks the Lantern Festival.The moon is full in the sky, and families are reunited on Earth. This brings the story of \"the lady Chang'e flying to the Moon,\" as well as the mission of Chang'e lunar exploration to people's minds. From ancient myth to modern-day legend, we reflect on the integration of culture and technology, exploring the deeper driving forces behind China's development. Innovative culture is undoubtedly one of the key elements.With a history of over 5,000 years, the spirit of innovation, a most distinctive trait of the Chinese nation, has not only been internalized as an enduring spiritual heritage of the Chinese people and enriched the soil for an innovative culture, but also externalized in the practical development of the New Era, stimulating the momentum for innovative progress.As the most technologically advanced lunar exploration mission in China's space history to date, Chang'e-6 has established an important milestone in China's lunar exploration program, offering a unique perspective through which we can observe the innovative spirit of the Chinese people and the innovative culture of the New Era.In his 2025 New Year's message, Chinese President Xi Jinping praised the technological innovation achievements such as how \"the Chang'e-6 lunar probe collected samples from the far side of the moon,\" stating that \"all this epitomizes the lofty spirit and dreams of the Chinese people to explore stars and oceans.\"During a meeting with the representatives of space scientists and engineers who participated in the research and development of the Chang'e-6 lunar mission, Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, stressed that the achievements of the lunar exploration project embody the wisdom and hard work of several generations of Chinese aerospace workers, and demonstrate the remarkable accomplishment the country has made in scientific and technological self-reliance in recent years.The New Era is far from ordinary. Why is it that China could always grow up in the baptism of wind and rain and emerge stronger after withstanding tests? In 2025, which marks the conclusion of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025), what enables the country to achieve its set goals? As China moves toward grand objectives, what empowers the country to overcome difficulties and challenges?From the tale of \"Chang'e flying to the moon\" to the legend of \"Chang'e\" lunar exploration missions, people could see a vivid revelation of the secrets behind the continuous vitality of the Chinese nation and a bright future for vibrant Chinese modernization.Dreams are never just dreams The Chinese people possess the great spirit of dreaming and creation. As a cultural achievement of combining the basic tenets of Marxism with the excellent traditional Chinese culture, the innovative culture of the New Era inherits the genes of the excellent traditional Chinese culture and provides an endless source of power for the pursuit of dreams. Xi has emphasized, \"The Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee's decision to implement the lunar exploration project is to pursue the nation's unyielding dream of flying into the sky and reaching for the moon.\"The legend of \"Chang'e flying to the moon\" is also where dreams begin.Over 2,000 years ago, the Qin bamboo slips in the text \"Gui Cang\" recorded the story of \"Chang'e flying to the moon.\" Qu Yuan, a patriotic poet from the ancient Chu state, which existed more than 2,200 years ago during the Warring States Period (475 BC-221 BC), first mentioned the moon rabbit in his long poem \"Tianwen,\" meaning \"Heavenly Questions.\" These ancient myths are beautiful and touching, with stories having been passed down through the ages in books and by word of mouth.For thousands of years, from the verse in the ancient classic Book of Songs, to poet Li Bai's \"My heart yearns for the blue sky and to embrace the bright moon,\" and to poet Su Shi's \"We share the beauty of the moon thousands of miles apart\"... Classic cultural masterpieces shine like stars in the sky and these are the verses that people can recite effortlessly.As far back as the Xia Dynasty (2070-1600 BC), ancient Chinese had developed the lunar calendar based on the cycles of the moon to guide agricultural production. During the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), Wan Hu attempted to fly to the sky using a self-made rocket, becoming the first recorded \"moon mission\" in human history. The brilliant cultural lineage illuminates the past and present, a shared memory embedded in Chinese people's genetic heritage.\"Exploring the vast universe, developing space programs and becoming an aerospace power have always been the dream we've been striving for.\" In the luster of the Chinese people's lives, dreams are never just dreams.The legend of flying to the moon, the longing for the moon, and the ambition to embrace the moon have been passed down through civilization, and forged into an incredibly tenacious spirit - the courage to pursue and realize dreams.In the late hours of December 15, 2013, Xi made a special visit to the Beijing Aerospace Control Center. At the same time, 380,000 kilometers away from Earth, the Chang'e-3 lunar probe successfully landed in the moon's Sinus Iridium, or the Bay of Rainbows, and the first moon rover Yutu (Jade Rabbit) safely departed from the lander to explore the lunar surface.Following the successful missions of Chang'e-3, Chang'e-4, Chang'e-5, and Chang'e-6, Xi met with space scientists and engineers who participated in these groundbreaking projects. The Chinese top leader emphasized, \"China is a big country and must attach importance to the real economy and take the path of self-reliance. Core technologies in key fields should be based on independent research and development.\"Xi also stressed promoting the lunar exploration spirit and giving full play to the advantages of the new system of pooling national resources and strengths to ascend the peak of science and technology, and serve the country's overall development. He emphasized embarking on a new interplanetary exploration journey step by step, promoting the innovative development of China's space exploration cause, and making greater contributions to humanity's peaceful use of space.These heartfelt innovation exhortations carry the weight of Chinese people's earnest aspirations for pursuing dreams. Rooted in dreams, grounded in innovation, and realized through practical efforts - this is the logical framework of great undertakings.\"If foreigners could do it, why couldn't we Chinese do it? \" This statement by Qian Xuesen, the founding father of Chinese aerospace exploration, encapsulates the ambition and determination of China's researchers to reach new heights in technology.\"Mom, when I go to college, I want to study aerospace engineering. I will find a way to visit the moon and help Grandma and you realize this dream!\" This was the aspiration of Ye Peijian, chief commander and designer of the Chang'e-1 project, who grew up listening to stories about the moon from his grandmother and mother, inspiring him to pursue a career in space exploration.Dreams can be vast and grand, but the journey to realize them is often fraught with challenges, twists, and turns.At the Beijing Planetarium, a piece of lunar rock no larger than a soybean quietly sits on display, attracting visits from numerous astronomy enthusiasts. In 1978, the US government gifted China this one gram lunar rock. Half of it was used for scientific research to uncover the rock's \"past and present,\" while the other half was showcased for educational purposes.\"At that time, my dream was to have a piece of lunar rock that China had collected itself,\" reminisced Ouyang Ziyuan, the first chief scientist for China's moon exploration program, filled with emotion. When dreams are ignited, the relentless efforts of countless dream chasers, nurtured by a culture of innovation, converge into an unstoppable force.Since the beginning of the New Era, China has entered the best period for technological innovation.From the Chang'e lunar missions to the \"Tianhe,\" the core module of China's space station, the \"Tianwen\" Mars exploration and the shining \"Beidou\" satellite system, and from \"Crust 1\" delving deep into Earth to the \"Fendouzhe (Striver)\" submersible exploring the depths of the ocean - these remarkable achievements reflect the Chinese nation's profound connection to the stars and the sea. They also serve as the most vivid manifestation of the innovative spirit that Chinese civilization has bestowed upon Chinese people.A journey of trials and triumphs There is no smooth road to innovation, let alone a shortcut. In the New Era, a culture of innovation inspires a spirit of perseverance in the face of challenges, paving the way for the realization of dreams.In ancient Chinese mythology, there exists a unique spirit characterized by remarkable qualities - from Pangu creating the world, and Nuwa patching up the sky, to Kuafu chasing the sun, Jingwei filling up the sea and Yugong removing mountains. These tales not only ignite dreams and inspire wisdom, but also advocate for proactive engagement and encourage action.On the journey of national rejuvenation, countless \"impossibilities\" have transformed into \"certainties\" through this unwavering pursuit of dreams. The tale of \"Chang'e flying to the moon\" has evolved into the legend of \"Chang'e\" lunar exploration, illustrating how myths can be transformed into legendary narratives.This is the footprint of innovation, marked by a courageous spirit of exploration.In January 2004, China's lunar exploration program was officially initiated. In October 2007, Chang'e-1 was launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Southwest China's Sichuan Province. With a lack of components, no ground testing conditions, and uncertainty about how to reach the moon, a research team of scientists under the age of 30, on average, began developing the first artificial satellite to orbit the moon from scratch. Sun Jiadong, the program's first chief designer, remarked, \"From the moment Chang'e-1 took off for the moon, I knew that once the door to lunar exploration was opened, the pace of deep space exploration would not stop.\"On December 14, 2013, Chang'e-3 landed on the moon, marking the first time that China had sent a spacecraft to soft land on the surface of an extraterrestrial body. It pioneered thermal control technology for two-phase fluid circuits and was equipped with a 360-degree panoramic camera, an infrared spectrometer, and an X-ray spectrometer, along with a new landing buffer system, autonomous navigation, and remote control systems. \"The more difficult the path, the more we want to explore it,\" said Sun, reflecting the team's innovative spirit.After Chang'e-3 successfully landed on the moon, what was the backup Chang'e-4 to do? The answer was to go to the far side of the moon!Following numerous debates, Wu Weiren, the chief designer of China's lunar exploration program, insisted, \"We should give Chang'e-4 greater vitality and more functions to explore the far side of the moon, which has never been reached by human spacecraft.\"In January 2019, Chang'e-4 made history by achieving the first soft landing on and exploration of the moon's far side, leaving its first footprints in lunar exploration history. In December 2020, Chang'e-5 returned to Earth with 1,731 grams of lunar samples, marking China's first extraterrestrial sample return while completing the three-step plan of orbiting, landing, and returning.In June 2024, Chang'e-6 touched down on the far side of the moon and collected samples from this rarely explored terrain for the first time in human history. The launch schedules for Chang'e-7 and Chang'e-8 have been confirmed, and China plans to send humans to the moon by 2030.As we embark on a new journey in this New Era, how do we continue to gain advantages, take initiative, and secure the future? The key lies in the spirit of daring to innovate and dream.This is a collaborative force of innovation. A drill and a shovel may seem like simple tools, but ensuring their proper use on the moon involves complex innovations that embody the wisdom of many teams.The design of lunar sampling equipment draws on geologists' experiences of digging on Earth; the lunar soil structure detector developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences acts as \"eyes\" providing information support; the \"arm\" for lunar soil collection is a robotic arm developed by a team from the Harbin Institute of Technology; and the strength of the \"joints\" and \"hands\" comes from the motor components and drilling subsystems developed by China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.As China's most complex and technologically advanced space system engineering project, the lunar exploration program is large-scale, systemically complex, and highly integrated, coordinated by the China National Space Administration and involving 3,000 institutes and nearly 100,000 participants.\"The three-step overall plan of the lunar exploration program could not have been completed on time without the traditional advantages of socialism in concentrating resources and the support of a new national system,\" said Hu Hao, chief designer of the Chang'e-5 and Chang'e-6 missions.When collective strength is harnessed, nothing is insurmountable. The government, enterprises, and research institutions work together, integrating five major systems: Satellites, launch vehicles, launch sites, measurement and control, and ground applications. From seasoned academicians to fresh graduates born in the 1990s, their unified collaboration has made the Chang'e program a collective effort, paving the way to the moon.Innovation has always been fraught with challenges. China's lunar exploration program has achieved six consecutive successes. The spirit of lunar exploration forged by researchers is a decisive factor in this success.Xi has urged efforts to promote the spirit of lunar exploration, characterized by \"chasing dreams, daring to explore, collaborating to overcome challenges, and achieving win-win cooperation,\" to further enhance the national confidence and pride of all Chinese people, and build up a great force to comprehensively promote the building of a strong country and the realization of national rejuvenation through Chinese modernization.This year's Spring Festival Gala featured a collaborative performance of the yangge dance by humans and machines. Behind the robot's ability to manipulate handkerchiefs lies the perfect support of AI-driven full-body motion control technology.The production and sales of new energy vehicles have also exceeded 12 million units, maintaining the world's top position for 10 consecutive years, reflecting the strong support of new quality productive forces. China's grain output has reached a new milestone of 1.4 trillion jin (700 billion kilograms) for the first time, with technology helping farmers secure their \"golden rice bowls,\" showcasing the intrinsic motivation for building a strong agricultural nation.The tide of the new era is surging. Countless stories of technological innovation are emerging, and an increasingly rich atmosphere of innovation culture is taking shape, providing stronger momentum for the giant ship \"China\" to move forward.Only open cooperation is the right path Technological progress is a global and contemporary issue, and only open cooperation is the right path. Continuously enriching and developing in an open and inclusive manner, and gathering the strength of the world through mutual learning and collaboration, are distinctive features of the innovation culture in the New Era.Xi has pointed out: \"The Chang'e lunar missions, which belong to both China and all people in the world, have provided a broad stage for international scientific and technological cooperation, and contributed Chinese wisdom and strength to the world's deep space exploration.\"Opening international applications for lunar soil samples, Russian researchers discovered unusual metallic iron-like linear crystals in the lunar soil collected by the Chang'e-5 probe. Carrying international payloads such as the European Space Agency's lunar surface ion analyzer, France's lunar radon detector, Italy's laser retroreflector, and Pakistan's CubeSat satellite, the Chang'e-6 missions assisted Pakistan in capturing its first lunar image and helped France complete its first lunar landing space project.\"Outer space is the common territory of humanity, and space exploration is a common cause for all mankind.\" The lunar exploration program has always been welcoming, promoting the global sharing of scientific achievements and ensuring that aerospace technology benefits humanity.For Chang'e-1, to ensure 24-hour uninterrupted tracking, China collaborated with the European Space Agency and relevant departments in Chile, using four foreign tracking stations for control. For Chang'e-4, the neutron radiation detector aboard the lander was developed by Germany, and ground station that China built in Argentina played an important role in the monitoring and control of the mission.Technological innovation has never been a solitary endeavor or a closed-door affair. One important reason for the success of the lunar exploration program is its unwavering commitment to open innovation, planning, and promoting technological development with a global perspective, and strengthening international cooperation in all aspects.Open cooperation leads to mutual benefits and win-win outcomes\"China's juncao,\" which transcends mountains and seas, has taken root in over 100 countries, becoming \"a gift from China to the world.\" \"China's Sky Eye,\" which continues to open up to the global scientific community, has helped research teams from 15 countries, including the US, the Netherlands, and Australia, conduct over 900 hours of observations, continually expanding humanity's limits in observing the sky. Agreements on intergovernmental scientific cooperation have been signed with over 80 Belt and Road Initiative partner countries, promoting the sharing of innovative achievements.Promoting open cooperation in science and technology is becoming a vivid practice of building a community of shared future for mankind. The world is interconnected, and humanity shares a common destiny.China has always relied on the hard work and innovative creativity of its people to develop and strengthen itself, achieving national development by combining the stimulation of intrinsic motivation with the peaceful utilization of external resources, firmly grasping the fate of its own development and progress in its own hands.China has always placed its own development within the coordinate system of human development, jointly addressing global challenges such as climate change, food security, and energy security, actively integrating into the global innovation network while deeply participating in global scientific governance, and working with countries around the world to create an open, fair, just, and non-discriminatory international environment for scientific and technological development.Innovation determines the future, and reform concerns the fate of the nation. Chinese modernization is full of momentum; the future of China is limitless. Let us unite our hearts and minds while gazing at the stars, and strive tenaciously while staying grounded, as we move toward our grand goals. https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202502/1328338.shtml",

            "description": "In an exclusive interview with Bollywood Hungama, Kunaal Roy Kapur opened up about the impact of the 2013 blockbuster Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani on his career, the significance of his character, and the hilarious dance sequence that became one of the film’s highlights.Social media boomReflecting on the film’s recent re-release and the sudden surge in his social media presence, Kunaal shared, “I have just 5,000 followers on Instagram, but after the re-release of Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, I got millions of likes.”Choosing impactful rolesKunaal, known for his effortless comic timing, spoke about his character’s importance in shaping the film’s narrative. “The importance of my character is that he brings change in the thoughts of the lead character—what love and sacrifice mean.” He further explained his approach to choosing roles, emphasizing that he looks for characters who make an impact. “I look at a character who brings change in the story, who is not a main lead but has a great impact on the perspective.”Iconic dance sequenceOne of the most memorable moments in the film was the dance sequence featuring Kunaal’s character, which had audiences in splits. Talking about how it came to life, he recalled, “The big whole thing was the dance. I sat with Ayaan Mukherji as I needed to be funny. People should laugh at and with the character at the same time. People should like it and find it funny.”The writer deserves the creditDespite his performance being a fan favorite, Kunaal humbly credited the film’s writers for shaping his role. “The credit of raising this green flag character totally goes to the writer. I can’t create that character; it has to come from a writer.” The dance sequence had a personal connection for Kunaal, making it even more special. “As my mother is a dancer and the song was of my sister-in-law Vidya Balan, it was a dance murder on the floor, and it was a whole family discussion.”Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: Kunaal Roy Kapur on Delhi Belly: “I slapped myself after reading the script”",

            "description": "SHENZHEN, China, Feb. 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- MicroCloud Hologram Inc. (NASDAQ: HOLO), (\"HOLO\" or the \"Company\"), a technology service provider, they are dedicated to advancing innovation and progress in quantum technology. Currently, they are developing an advanced high-order quantum switch technology, which lays a solid foundation for achieving more efficient and secure quantum communication. In predicting qubit communication scenarios, HOLO has applied advanced quantum mechanics theories and mathematical models to conduct in-depth research on various possibilities of qubit communication. Through continuous derivation and verification, the key factors and patterns have been gradually revealed. Based on theoretical research, HOLO has utilized high-performance computers and specialized quantum simulation software to construct multiple complex quantum communication scenario models. These models simulate in detail the transmission process of qubits, the operation of quantum switches, and the impact of different environmental factors on communication. By collecting and analyzing large amounts of simulation experiment data, the models have been continuously optimized, with the aim of making the simulation results more closely aligned with real-world conditions, thereby providing reliable references for practical applications. After gaining a deep understanding of predicting qubit communication scenarios, HOLO began to define and construct an innovative high-order quantum switch. Starting from the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, HOLO developed a design scheme for a high-order quantum switch composed of two quantum switches. The uniqueness of this scheme lies in the fact that its application sequence is controlled by another high-order quantum system. This means that by precisely controlling the state of this high-order quantum system, the application sequence of the quantum switches can be flexibly adjusted. During the design process, HOLO carefully considered various potential challenges and solutions, striving to ensure that the high-order quantum switch performs excellently in practical applications. With the powerful tool of the high-order quantum switch, HOLO began exploring how to apply quantum switches in quantum superposition to achieve more efficient qubit transmission. First, an in-depth study of the working principles of quantum switches was conducted to understand their performance and characteristics in different states. Next, advanced quantum control techniques were used to place the quantum switch in specific quantum superposition states. During this process, precise control of various parameters of the quantum system, such as energy, phase, and spin, was required to ensure that the quantum switch remained stable in the quantum superposition state. HOLO continuously optimized the control strategy during the experiments, striving to achieve the best performance of the quantum switch in the quantum superposition state, thus providing strong support for future quantum communication technologies. To further enhance the performance of quantum communication systems, HOLO has also focused on developing a novel quantum error correction algorithm. Quantum information is easily affected by various noise and interference during transmission, leading to data loss and errors. To address this issue, HOLO has conducted in-depth research on quantum error correction theory and, in combination with the latest research findings, designed an efficient quantum error correction scheme. This scheme utilizes redundant qubits and complex encoding techniques to detect and correct potential errors without damaging the quantum information. Simulation experiments have verified that this error correction algorithm significantly improves the reliability and stability of quantum communication, providing strong support for achieving long-distance, high-fidelity quantum communication. In the future, HOLO will continue to focus on innovation and breakthroughs in quantum technology, constantly exploring the potential applications of quantum technology in more fields. As quantum technology continues to develop and improve, HOLO believes it will play a key role in information security, computational capabilities, sensing technologies, and other areas, bringing profound impact to human society. HOLO will collaborate with major research institutions and enterprises to promote the popularization and application of quantum technology, contributing to the creation of a safer, more efficient, and intelligent future.

            "description": "सामान्यत: दो तरह के व्यक्तियों की चर्चा होता है, एक भला आदमी और दूसरा बुरा आदमी। कहा जाता है- कर भला तो हो भला... जो व्यक्ति जीवन में दूसरों का भला करता है, उसका भला स्वयं ही हो जाता है। इसके साथ ही ऐसे व्यक्ति भी खूब मिलते हैं जो भलाई के नाम पर लोगों को ठगकर अपना ही भला करते रहते हैं। सिर्फ धन से ही नहीं बल्कि किसी पीड़ित की तन और मन से सेवा करके या भावनात्मक रूप से सहयोग देकर भी भला किया जा सकता है। एरोड्रम क्षेत्र में दिलीप नगर नैनोद स्थित शंकराचार्य मठ इंदौर के अधिष्ठाता ब्रह्मचारी डॉ. गिरीशानंदजी महाराज ने अपने नित्य प्रवचन में बुधवार को यह बात कही। बुधवार को पूर्णिमा के अवसर पर मठ में नियमानुसार सत्यनारायण भगवान की कथा हुई। इसके बाद डॉ. गिरीशानंदजी महाराज ने आशीर्वचन दिए। संसार में चार तरह के व्यक्ति महाराजश्री ने एक दृष्टांत सुनाया- एक महात्मा थे। वे प्रवचन कर रहे थे। वे बता रहे थे- संसार में चार तरह के व्यक्ति होते हैं। एक तो वे जो न खुद का भला करते हैं, न दूसरों का भला करते हैं। दूसरे केवल अपनी भलाई चाहते हैं। तीसरे केवल दूसरों का भला करते हैं, चौथे अपने भले के साथ दूसरों का भी भला करते हैं। अब इनमें से आपको कौन सा व्यक्ति बनना है? ये आप स्वयं सोचिए। बहुत से व्यक्ति केवल अखबारों के पन्नों में ही भला करते हैं। लेकिन किसी का भला नहीं करते हैं। भला करने के प्रचार से वे केवल अपना ही भला करते हैं। दिखावे के लिए लोगों को प्रचारित करते रहते हैं कि हम गरीबों का भला करते हैं, विद्यार्थियों का भला करते हैं। जिनके पास भला करने का सामर्थ्य है, पर समय नहीं है, वे इन ठगोरों की बातों में आकर भला करने के नाम पर इन ठगोरों का भला करते रहते हैं। ऐसे लोगों से सावधान रहना चाहिए।",

            "description": "Axis Bank, one of the largest private sector banks in India, today announced the introduction of a first-of-its-kind feature that enables customers to open Fixed Deposits (FDs) with its mobile application, using funds from their non-Axis Bank accounts via UPI and Net Banking payment options. Axis Bank is the first private sector bank to introduce this new-age banking feature by leveraging the Account Aggregator ecosystem, thus creating a seamless banking experience for its customers.With this feature, Axis Bank’s ETB (Existing-To-Bank) customers with valid KYC can open a Fixed Deposit with funds from their other bank accounts through UPI or Net Banking payment options. The FD opening will be processed after successful payment completion and receipt of funds from the payment gateway service provider.This new feature highlights Axis Bank’s adoption of open banking principles, eliminating barriers like payee addition, fund transfers between accounts, and separate FD opening steps. This process enables customers to digitally invest in Fixed Deposits with Axis Bank at attractive interest rates and higher returns, where availability of funds in their Axis Bank Savings account is no longer a constraint.Speaking on this launch, Sameer Shetty, President & Head – Digital Business & Transformation, Axis Bank, said, “Axis Bank believes in the power of ‘OPEN’ Banking and we have been continuously investing in digital-first products that reimagine customer propositions. In this endeavour, we are excited to introduce this new feature that empowers customers to seamlessly invest in Axis Bank Fixed Deposits directly with funds from other banks. This proposition offers a hassle-free banking experience and provides convenience to customers by eliminating the step of transferring funds from one account to another before opening an FD. We believe this is transformational and a step further towards the future of banking.”“UPI together with Account Aggregator framework makes a powerful proposition, which is scaling up rapidly in India. Axis Bank has leveraged this ecosystem to offer a seamless customer-friendly experience for booking Fixed Deposits.” Sameer further added.",

The family, including Mukesh Ambani, Kokilaben Ambani, Anant Ambani, Radhika Merchant, Shloka Mehta, and Akash Ambani, chose traditional yet stylish outfits for the special occasion. Let’s take a closer look at their elegant fashion choices.Radhika Ambani looked stunning in a beautiful ethnic ensemble that balanced tradition with elegance. She wore a navy blue silk kurta with a loose, comfortable fit, a V-neckline, and elbow-length sleeves. The kurta featured delicate golden zari embroidery along the neckline and borders, giving it a royal touch. Radhika paired the kurta with mint green dhoti pants and a matching dupatta, which added a modern, refreshing twist to her outfit. She kept her accessories minimal but elegant, choosing diamond stud earrings and a delicate chain necklace. Her makeup was natural with kohled eyes, defined brows, and nude lipstick, while her hair was neatly tied in a low ponytail. Overall, Radhika’s look was a perfect mix of tradition and modern style.",

            "description": "KAWASAKI, Japan, Feb. 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Fujitsu Limited and Yokohama National University today announced the achievement of the world's first real-time prediction of multiple typhoon-associated tornadoes using advanced supercomputing technology, significantly improving disaster preparedness. The new technology utilizes optimized large-scale parallel processing coupled with the enhanced Cloud Resolving Storm Simulator (CReSS), a weather simulator developed by Professor Kazuhisa Tsuboki on Fujitsu's Fugaku supercomputer. This allows for a single, high-resolution simulations encompassing both large-scale typhoons and smaller-scale tornadoes, resulting in accurate, real-time predictions. Previously, during simulations of Typhoon No. 10's tornadoes, which hit Japan's Kyushu area in August 2024, it took more than 11 hours to predict whether or not tornadoes would occur, making the predictions not practicably applicable. This technology was able to drastically reduce prediction time to 80 minutes, allowing the two partners to predict the occurrence of a tornado four hours in advance. This prediction calculation used only 5% of Fugaku's computational resources, indicating the potential for even larger-scale and faster predictions in the future. The two partners will release the enhanced CReSS to the research community within fiscal year 2024, significantly improving the prediction of severe weather events and enhancing disaster mitigation efforts. For full release click here Background Approximately 20% of tornadoes in Japan occur alongside typhoons. In response to increasing tornado damage, Japan began issuing tornado warnings in 2008. However, compared to weather phenomena like precipitation, which can be predicted with high accuracy, tornadoes are difficult to predict due to their small scale and short duration. Tornado warnings currently have a validity period of about one hour, and there is a demand for longer warning periods. Fujitsu and Yokohama National University initiated a joint research project in November 2022, aiming to address societal challenges related to increasingly severe typhoons exacerbated by global warming. This collaboration, conducted under the Fujitsu Small Research Lab's \"Fujitsu - Yokohama National University Typhoon Science and Technology Research Center Collaborative Research Laboratory,\" focuses on understanding typhoon formation mechanisms and accelerating and improving the accuracy of typhoon prediction simulations.",

            "description": "Blazing Inferno Destroys Two Factories in Indore A massive fire decimated two factories in the industrial hub of Indore's Tigria Badshah locality, authorities confirmed. On Wednesday, thick black smoke billowed from the affected sites, alarming residents and businesses in the vicinity. The inferno reportedly originated in an ink and printing facility before rapidly engulfing an adjacent factory. The swift spread of flames prompted an urgent response from the fire department, led by sub-inspector Roopchand Pandit, who confirmed the structural collapse of the tin walls. Eyewitness Vishal Tomar noted the absence of employees during the incident, which resulted in no injuries or loss of life. Authorities are currently investigating to determine the cause and assess the financial impact of the blaze.",

            "description": "In a fiery speech at the AI Active Summit in Paris, U.S. Vice President JD Vance issued a stark warning about growing international regulations on American tech companies. Calling out foreign governments for tightening restrictions, Vance made it clear—the Trump administration will not tolerate policies that hinder U.S. innovation. Vance took aim at the EU’s Digital Services Act and GDPR, arguing that excessive compliance costs and censorship rules threaten the future of tech. He also highlighted AI’s dependence on reliable power and semiconductor manufacturing, warning that de-industrialization and regulatory overreach could stifle the next great industrial revolution. Beyond regulations, Vance tackled AI bias, censorship, and foreign adversaries weaponising AI, pledging that the Trump administration will protect free speech and prevent American AI technology from falling into the wrong hands. Is AI being hijacked for control and censorship? Will strict regulations kill innovation? Watch now as JD Vance delivers a no-holds-barred speech that could shape the future of AI and global tech policies!",

            "description": "The Yogi government has made fool-proof preparations for the successful organization of the fourth bathing festival, Magh Purnima, on Wednesday under Mahakumbh-2025. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has issued clear directives to ensure that no devotee, Kalpvasi, or ordinary citizen faces any inconvenience in the Mahakumbh Mela area or across Prayagraj city. In line with this, the local administration and police department are working with full readiness, focusing on traffic management, smooth vehicular movement, parking, security, surveillance, and overall monitoring. Providing insights into these preparations, Prayagraj Police Commissioner Tarun Gaba emphasized that the Uttar Pradesh government and UP Police are committed to offering devotees a seamless and hassle-free experience at the Mahakumbh. He highlighted that traffic management plans were formulated months in advance and are being successfully implemented. He added, \"Despite the surge in vehicles towards the weekend and intermittent high-traffic periods, the administration and police force have efficiently managed challenges through tireless efforts. As a result, traffic remains smooth on all routes leading to the fair area and within Prayagraj, ensuring no congestion in the city. \" He added, \"The police and administration have urged all devotees to utilize designated parking areas along their route and avoid attempting to reach Sangam directly, as specific arrangements have been made for different routes. \" Commissioner Tarun Gaba reiterated that the administration works round the clock to ensure a hassle-free experience for devotees while maintaining smooth traffic flow. He appealed to visitors to park only in designated areas to facilitate orderly movement. The police and local administration are utilizing ANPR and AI-enabled cameras to monitor the movement of devotees and regulate traffic in the fair area. Additionally, real-time data is being gathered from toll plazas and officials in neighbouring districts to track incoming vehicle numbers and routes, enabling appropriate traffic management. To ensure a smooth experience for all, the fair area has been declared a no-vehicle zone a day before the Magh Purnima bathing festival. Vehicular movement across Prayagraj city is also restricted from Tuesday evening. A dedicated traffic plan has been implemented for the Kalpvasis residing in the fair area, and all necessary information has been conveyed to them. Quotes: The administration has also urged the public to refrain from spreading misinformation or believing in rumors on social media. Traffic-related challenges have been effectively addressed by deploying additional police personnel and continuous efforts. Tarun Gaba Police Commissioner, Prayagraj Traffic is flowing smoothly on all major routes, with no significant increase in congestion over the past few hours. Junctions within the city are also witnessing seamless vehicular movement. Prashant Kumar DGP, Uttar Pradesh",

In a letter addressed to the Delhi Police Commissioner, Khan declared that he has not fled and is present in his constituency, stating, \"Mai kahin nahi bhaga hun, mai apni Vidhan Sabha mein hi hun\" (I have not fled, I am in my constituency). Khan further clarified that the individual the police had come to arrest, whose bail has already been granted, was not connected to him in any unlawful manner. His letter suggests that the charges against him are politically motivated, designed to tarnish his reputation. Khan’s supporters argue that the ongoing investigation is an attempt to weaken his political standing. Despite the raids and ongoing police inquiries, Khan remains steadfast, stating he is willing to cooperate with the authorities while continuing to challenge the legitimacy of the case against him. The investigation is still underway as police seek to clarify the details surrounding the allegations.",

            "description": "London: In yet another case of racial abuse on a UK train, a 26-year-old Indian-origin woman was subjected to a vicious tirade by an allegedly intoxicated man, highlighting growing concerns over hate speech in public spaces. The incident unfolded on Sunday as Gabrielle Forsyth was travelling from London to Manchester. During a casual conversation with a fellow passenger, she mentioned her work with a charity supporting immigrants. This seemingly innocuous remark triggered an aggressive reaction from another passenger, who was drinking from a can and proceeded to launch a xenophobic rant. A video of the incident, which has since been deleted, captured the man shouting racist remarks at Forsyth and other passengers, boasting about England's colonial past. \"You're in England, you are claiming something. You would not be in England if you weren't claiming something. English people conquered the world and gave it back to you. We conquered India, we didn't want it, we gave it back to you,\" he stated. Forsyth, recalling the ordeal, said, \"He heard the word 'immigrant' and his immediate reaction was anger and aggression. It was very jarring. I felt strongly that what he said was wrong. It was an insane situation. I recorded it for my own protection.\" After posting the video online, Forsyth found herself facing an overwhelming wave of abuse. \"The amount of hate I have received from this one video is insane. I've been called slurs I didn't even know existed. Violent rhetoric and hate speech can now proliferate so easily on X. I care deeply about the rights of people of colour in this country, and I do think we are backsliding,\" she said. Forsyth has reported the incident to the British Transport Police (BTP). She further expressed pride in her heritage, stating, \"Being Indian, being the daughter of an immigrant, being in touch with my history and heritage is a blessing. I stand up for myself and for people of colour, and I back us all to the hilt.\" This comes just days after another racist confrontation on an Avanti West Coast train, where a woman told an NHS dentist to \"go back to your own country.\" A video of that incident showed the woman directing racist remarks at a fellow passenger, an NHS dentist, telling him to \"go back to Morocco or Tunisia.\" The dentist, who was born in the UK, responded, \"Why would you say that? That's so disrespectful. I was born here. Were you born here?\" To which the woman dismissively replied, \"Doesn't look like it.\" When he firmly told her, \"Do not ever disrespect me like that,\" she retorted with, \"Serves you right.\" These back-to-back incidents have sparked fresh concerns about rising intolerance and racial abuse in public spaces across the UK.(IANS)",

Amid public outrage, he issued an apology, acknowledging his mistake Following a controversial remark on India’s Got Latent, Ranveer Allahbadia, also known as BeerBiceps, has reportedly lost thousands of followers on social media. Data from influencer marketing platform Qoruz suggests that his personal Instagram account saw a decline of approximately 4,153 followers, while his 'BeerBiceps' handle lost around 4,205 followers The controversy might also affect his YouTube subscriber count and brand collaborations.

A police complaint was filed against Allahbadia and co-judges Samay Raina, Ashish Chanchlani, Jaspreet Singh, and Apoorva Makhija, citing sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) for promoting obscene content. The episode has since been taken down, and an investigation is ongoing Allahbadia later issued a public apology, acknowledging that his remark was inappropriate and not humorous.

            "description": "The United States and the United Kingdom have declined to sign a global declaration advocating for \"inclusive and sustainable\" artificial intelligence. The agreement, endorsed by 60 nations at a Paris summit, aims to establish ethical, transparent, and secure AI governance frameworks. However, both Washington and London expressed reservations about its effectiveness in addressing broader regulatory and security concerns.'Not Enough Clarity'As reported by The Guardian, a UK government representative acknowledged alignment with many aspects of the declaration but noted that it \"didn’t provide enough practical clarity on global governance, nor sufficiently address harder questions around national security and the challenge AI poses to it.\"\"We continue to collaborate with our global partners, as demonstrated by our commitments on sustainability and cybersecurity at the Paris AI Action Summit,\" the spokesperson stated.Vance's CritiqueThe decision was announced shortly after US Vice President JD Vance delivered a pointed critique of European AI regulations, cautioning against \"excessive regulation of the AI sector [that] could kill a transformative industry.\"Addressing global leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Vance warned that stringent oversight could hinder technological progress. He particularly criticised the European Union’s regulatory stance, arguing that \"we need international regulatory regimes that foster the creation of AI technology rather than strangle it, and we need our European friends, in particular, to look to this new frontier with optimism rather than trepidation.\"'Little Strategic Room'While some speculated that the UK’s refusal to sign was influenced by US policy, a government source dismissed such claims, reported The Guardian. However, as reported by The Guardian, a Labour MP suggested that \"we have little strategic room but to be downstream of the US,\" warning that overly restrictive policies could discourage collaboration with major US AI firms.Campaigners and AI experts voiced concern over the UK’s stance, warning that it could undermine its credibility as a leader in ethical AI development. Andrew Dudfield of Full Fact stressed the need for \"bolder government action to protect people from corrosive AI-generated misinformation,\" while Gaia Marcus from the Ada Lovelace Institute argued that rejecting the declaration \"go[es] against the vital global governance that AI needs.\"Additionally, Vance warned against AI cooperation with authoritarian regimes, indirectly referencing China. Citing concerns over surveillance technology and data security, he emphasised that \"partnering with such regimes, it never pays off in the long term.\" \"Some of us in this room have learned from experience partnering with them means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure. Should a deal seem too good to be true, just remember the adage that we learned in Silicon Valley, if you aren’t paying for the product: you are the product.\"Vance also reflected on last year’s AI Safety Summit in the UK, implying that excessive caution could impede progress. He argued that discussions on emerging technologies must strike a balance between risk management and fostering innovation. His speech underscored a fundamental rift in global AI governance that pits regulatory caution against technological advancement.",

Mamata Banerjee's government launched Lakshmi Bhandar after coming to power. This allowance is for the women of the state. The government provides Rs 1000 to general caste women and Rs 1200 to SC or ST women every month. Now the Modi government is coming to compete with Mamata's Lakshmi Bhandar. Mahila Samman Yojana is coming. This scheme has been launched so that the women of the country do not lag behind financially. The government will give Rs 2100 per month under the Mahila Samman Yojana. Those above 18 years of age will get this benefit. However, the entire process of Mahila Samman Yojana will be digital. This decision has been taken to maintain transparency and reduce harassment of people. Mahila Samman Yojana has been launched to empower women. Modi will give Rs 2100 every month.

The critique from Hazare did not go unanswered, as the social activist remarked on people's interpretations being shaped by their mental frameworks.Raut further asserted that without figures like Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia, Hazare would not have gained significant visibility to protest against corruption in Delhi. Hazare, however, countered these criticisms by implying that Raut views reality through a politically tinted perspective.",

First, global readjustment to a new world order where countries are being seen as commodities that can be bought and sold. Second, that valuations are still not cheap. And third, and most important, lower-than-expected earnings growth. The coming together of all three has created the market mayhem that we have been witnessing these past weeks.
