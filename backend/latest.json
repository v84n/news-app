The court stated that a Hindu woman's marriage to a Muslim man does not automatically change her religion to Islam. Clarifying its stance, the court emphasized that a claim of religious conversion through marriage cannot be made unless there is concrete evidence to support it. This statement sheds light on the legal and societal nuances of interfaith unions and underscores the importance of individual choice in matters of faith. The court's remarks aim to address misconceptions and promote clarity regarding such marriages.

            "description": "पटना से 100 किलोमीटर दूर गंगा किनारे वाला मोकामा। पहले दाल का कटोरा और औद्योगिक नगरी के रूप में पहचान थी। स्पीनी मिल, भारत बैगन, बाटा और मैकडॉवेल जैसी नामी कंपनियों की यूनिट दिन-रात घन-घन करती थी। आज मशीनें सड़ रहीं है और गलियों में गोलियों की तड़तड़ाहट सुनाई दे रही है। कहावत है- मोकामा में एक पत्ता भी बगैर अनंत सिंह से पूछे नहीं हिलता। 1975 में तस्करी से शुरू हुआ खेल, हत्या, हथियारों की सप्लाई, रंगदारी से लेकर रेलवे टेंडर में बादशाहत कायम करने तक पहुंचा। बाहुबली अनंत सिंह और सोनू-मोनू की अदावत से एक बार फिर मोकामा चर्चा में है। खैर, दोनों जेल में बंद हैं तो इलाके में फिलहाल कुछ दिनों की शांति है। वैसे मोकामा को जानने वाले मानते हैं कि यहां जब शांति दिखती है तो वो आने वाला तूफान का संकेत ही साबित होता है। अनंत सिंह और सोनू-मोनू के बीच जेल यात्रा का ये सीन एक पड़ाव मात्र है। मंडे स्पेशल स्टोरी में पढ़िए और देखिए...मोकामा के उन बाहुबलियों की कहानी, जिन्होंने सियासत की दशा और दिशा दोनों बदली। बात 1970-71 की है। नदवां गांव के चंद्रदीप सिंह के बेटे दिलीप सिंह टमटम चलवाया करते थे। इससे उनका घर खर्च चलता था। इसी दौरान उनकी मुलाकात तस्कर कामदेव से हुई। कामदेव भारत से नेपाल सामान की तस्करी करता था। उससे धीरे-धीरे दिलीप सिंह की नजदीकी बढ़ी और उसका राइट हैंड हो गए। कुछ दिन बाद कामदेव की हत्या हो गई। और उसकी कुर्सी पर दिलीप सिंह ने कब्जा कर लिया। 1975 आते-आते उनका पूरे मोकामा एरिया में दबदबा हो गया। क्राइम की दुनिया में दिलीप सिंह बड़े नाम हो गए थे, लेकिन रिकॉर्ड में उनके खिलाफ कोई संगीन मुकदमा दर्ज नहीं था। कांग्रेस नेता ने चुनाव जीतने के लिए दिलीप सिंह का लिया साथ 80 के दशक में देश में चुनाव बैलेट पेपर से होता था। यह वही दौर था जब राजनेता अपनी जीत के लिए बाहुबल का सहारा लेते थे। बिहार में बूथ कैप्चरिंग अपने परवान पर था। 1980 विधानसभा चुनाव में श्याम सुंदर सिंह धीरज कांग्रेस के सीताराम केसरी गुट से चुनाव लड़ रहे थे। जगन्नाथ मिश्र उन्हें हराना चाहते थे। कांग्रेस की आंतरिक सियासत से उबरने के लिए तब पहली बार श्याम सुंदर सिंह धीरज ने इलाके के दबंग दिलीप सिंह की मदद ली। उन्होंने खुलकर सपोर्ट किया और धीरज चुनाव जीत गए। मोकामा के जानकारों की मानें तो ये औपचारिक तौर पर यहां की सियासत में बाहुबलियों की एंट्री थी। मंत्री ने मिलने से मना किया तो चुनाव में हरा दिया मोकामा के सियासी गलियारों में एक किस्सा है कि श्याम सुंदर सिंह धीरज को 1985 का चुनाव जीताने के बाद एक बार दिलीप सिंह उनसे मिलने पटना के सरकारी आवास में चले गए थे। इस पर उन्होंने मिलने से मना कर दिया। तब उन्होंने दिलीप सिंह से कहा था, \"दिन के समय मिलने मत आया करो। तुम कोई शरीफ आदमी या अधिकारी तो हो नहीं। शाम होने के बाद आया करो और वो भी छुपकर।\" ये बात दिलीप सिंह को इतनी चुभी कि उन्होंने श्याम सुंदर सिंह के खिलाफ चुनाव लड़ने का ऐलान कर दिया। 1990 विधानसभा चुनाव में दिलीप सिंह से श्याम सुंदर सिंह धीरज 20 हजार से ज्यादा वोट से हार गए। इसके बाद 1995 के चुनाव में भी हारे। तब लालू यादव ने इनाम के तौर पर दिलीप सिंह को मंत्री बना दिया। खास बात है कि पहली बार जब श्याम सुंदर सिंह धीरज चुनाव हारे तो उन्होंने दिलीप सिंह के शागिर्द सूरजभान सिंह को तोड़ लिया। और दोनों को एक-दूसरे के खिलाफ कर दिया। मूल रूप से मोकामा में जन्मे सूरजभान के पिता एक किराना दुकान में काम करते थे। दिलीप सिंह के शागिर्द बन 80 के दशक में इन्होंने क्राइम की दुनिया में एंट्री की। कहा जाता है कि जहां सूरजभान के पिता काम करते थे उसी कारोबारी से उन्होंने रंगदारी मांग ली थी। तब छोटे-मोटे क्राइम करने वाले सूरजभान 90 का दशक आते-आते जुर्म की दुनिया में बड़े नाम बन गए। इन पर हत्या, लूट, अपहरण के एक के बाद एक मामले दर्ज होते चले गए। कद के साथ सूरजभान अपना दायरा भी बढ़ाते चले गए। मोकामा से निकलकर बिहार, झारखंड से लेकर यूपी तक में इन्होंने अपना साम्राज्य स्थापित किया। क्राइम की दुनिया में सूरजभान को आगे बढ़ाने का श्रेय कांग्रेस के पूर्व विधायक श्याम सुंदर सिंह धीरज और अनंत सिंह के बड़े भाई दिलीप सिंह को ही दिया जाता है। रेलवे में टेंडर के यूपी के बाहुबली पर हमला करवाया सूरजभान रेलवे टेंडर और ठेकेदारी में अपना वर्चस्व कायम करना चाहते थे। वे इसमें सफल भी हुए। 90 के दशक में बिहार से लेकर झारखंड तक रेलवे के हर टेंडर पर इनका कब्जा होता था। UP में भी ये ऐसा करना चाहते थे, लेकिन वहां इनकी राह का रोड़ा बाहुबली हरिशंकर तिवारी और वीरेंद्र प्रताप शाही थे। UP एसटीफ के संस्थापक सदस्य रहे IPS राजेश शर्मा एक पॉडकास्ट में बताते हैं, \"हरिशंकर तिवारी और वीरेंद्र प्रताप शाही को रास्ते से हटाने के लिए सूरजभान सिंह ने यूपी के ही बाहुबली श्रीप्रकाश शुक्ला को तैयार किया। उसे AK-47 उपलब्ध कराया।\" राजेश शर्मा बताते हैं... तब उन्होंने पहली बार सूरजभान के यहां AK-47 देखा था। श्रीप्रकाश शुक्ला सूरजभान को अपना गुरु मानता था। यूपी से क्राइम कर जब भागता था तो उसे सूरजभान सिंह मोकामा टाल में शरण देते थे। बेगूसराय के बाहुबली से चला खूनी जंग, मंत्री के मर्डर में जुड़ा नाम 90 के दशक में बिहार के दो बाहुबली अशोक सम्राट और सूरजभान की दुश्मनी का किस्सा सरेआम था। अशोक सम्राट नेताओं को अपना संरक्षण देता था। इसके सहारे वो बिहार से लेकर UP तक अपना वर्चस्व कायम करना चाहता था। उसके वर्चस्व को सूरजभान सिंह चुनौती दे रहे थे। सूरजभान सिंह पर राबड़ी सरकार में मंत्री रहे बृज बिहारी प्रसाद की हत्या का आरोप लगा। निचली अदालत ने उन्हें इस मामले में सजा भी सुनाई, लेकिन बाद में हाईकोर्ट और सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने बरी कर दिया। दिलीप सिंह को हराकर सियासत की दुनिया में रखा कदम जुर्म की दुनिया में अपना पैर जमाने के बाद 2000 में सूरजभान सिंह ने सियासत की दुनिया में कदम रखा। उन्होंने मोकामा से 2000 में तत्कालीन बिहार सरकार के मंत्री दिलीप सिंह के खिलाफ जेल से ही पर्चा भरा। अपने पहले चुनाव में ही दिलीप सिंह को 70 हजार वोट से हरा दिया था। उस वक्त सूरजभान पर पुलिस रिकॉर्ड में UP और बिहार में कुल 26 मामले दर्ज थे। विधानसभा का चुनाव जीतने के बाद 2004 में वह रामविलास पासवान की लोकजन शक्ति पार्टी के टिकट से बलिया (बिहार) के सांसद बने। अनंत सिंह बाहुबली दिलीप सिंह के छोटे भाई हैं। कहा जाता है कि ये क्राइम की दुनिया में नहीं आना चाहते थे। हालात ऐसे बने कि दिलीप सिंह के बाद उनकी क्राइम और पॉलिटिक्स दोनों की बागडोर अनंत सिंह ने न सिर्फ संभाली, बल्कि उसे नए आयाम तक ले गए। अनंत सिंह के बारे में कहा जाता है कि जवानी के दिनों में ये साधु बनने की चाहत रखते थे। इसके लिए वह हरिद्वार भी भाग कर गए। लेकिन वहां साधुओं के साथ ही मुठभेड़ करने लगे। खुद से ज्यादा साधुओं की आपसी लड़ाई देखकर उनका मन वैराग्य की दुनिया से उचट गया। इसी बीच उन तक खबर पहुंची कि उनके सबसे बड़े भाई बिरंची सिंह का मर्डर हो गया है। ये सुनते ही सबकुछ छोड़कर लौट आए। अब बैरागी बनने गए अनंत सिंह के सिर पर अपने भाई की हत्या का बदला लेने का भूत सवार था। बाद में उन्होंने हत्यारों को ढूंढ कर मारा और भाई का बदला लिया। पड़ोसी विवेका पहलवान ही बना जानी दुश्मन, वर्षों तक चला खूनी संघर्ष अनंत सिंह क्राइम की दुनिया में तेजी से बढ़ रहे थे। उनका इस तरह आगे बढ़ना उनके पड़ोसी विवेका पहलवान को रास नहीं आया। दोनों एक-दूसरे के दुश्मन बन गए। दोनों के घर की दीवार एक जरूर थी, लेकिन दोनों एक-दूसरे का जान लेने को आतुर थे। दोनों के बीच वर्षों तक खूनी संघर्ष चला। बेटी के पिता को नहीं करते निराश 90 के दशक में जातियों के खूनी संघर्ष में जलते बिहार में अनंत सिंह की पहचान भूमिहार रक्षक की थी। 2004 आते-आते अनंत सिंह इलाके के बाहुबली बन चुके थे। इनका सिक्का चलने लगा था। उनके बारे में कहा जाता है कि वे अपने दरवाजे पर मदद के लिए आए बेटी के पिता को कभी निराश नहीं करते। मोकामा से सूरजभान का सियासी वर्चस्व समाप्त किया अनंत सिंह के बड़े भाई दिलीप सिंह को हराकर 2000 में सूरजभान विधायक बने थे। इसके बाद दिलीप सिंह का प्रभाव कम होने लगा। 2003 में विधान परिषद चुने गए थे, लेकिन अक्टूबर 2006 में पटना में हार्ट अटैक से निधन हो गया। 2004 लोकसभा चुनाव में नीतीश कुमार ने अनंत सिंह की मदद ली। इसका फायदा उन्हें 2005 के विधानसभा चुनाव में मिला। JDU ने अनंत सिंह को मोकामा से उम्मीदवार बना दिया। तब उन्होंने सूरजभान के समर्थित लोजपा के नलिनी रंजन शर्मा उर्फ ललन सिंह को हराकर राजनीति में जीत का ताज पहना। इसके बाद से आज तक मोकामा सीट पर इनका कब्जा है। हत्या, रंगदारी, अपहरण के 38 केस अनंत सिंह ने 2005 के अपने चुनावी हलफनामे में मात्र एक केस का जिक्र किया था। जैसे-जैसे उन्होंने राजधानी की गलियों की खाक छानी, फाइल मोटी होती गई। 2020 विधानसभा चुनाव के दायर हलफनामे के मुताबिक, उन पर हत्या की कोशिश के 11 और जान से मारने की धमकी के 9 केस सहित 38 FIR दर्ज हैं। ------------------------------------- ये भी पढ़ें... अनंत सिंह 14 दिनों के लिए जेल भेजे गए:बाढ़ कोर्ट में किया सरेंडर,

ने बताया कि जमानत की अर्जी दी गई थी, लेकिन उसपर सुनवाई अभी लंबित है। शुक्रवार दोपहर 1.20 बजे बाहुबली ने बाढ़ कोर्ट में सरेंडर किया। कोर्ट के बाहर बाहुबली के समर्थकों का जमावड़ा लगा रहा। पूरी खबर

This decision follows Israel's request for an extension beyond the original 60-day deadline, stipulated in November's ceasefire with Hezbollah.The delay has incited significant unrest; Israeli forces opened fire on Lebanese protesters, resulting in 22 deaths and 124 injuries. Among the deceased were six women and a Lebanese soldier. Demonstrators, flying Hezbollah flags, sought Israel's compliance with the ceasefire terms.In response, Israel attributed the demonstrations to Hezbollah's instigation. Both nations remain under international pressure to adhere to ceasefire commitments, with UN and US involvement. Lebanese officials, including President Joseph Aoun, emphasized the nation's rights and urged calm amid the heightened tensions.",

            "description": "Trump's Proposal for Gaza Sparks Wide Rejection The recent proposal by former U.S. President Donald Trump has generated significant controversy. Trump suggested that Jordan and Egypt absorb Palestinians from conflict-torn Gaza, a move met with strong opposition from various stakeholders.Hamas, the ruling militant group in Gaza, firmly rejected the idea, underscoring the persistent fear among Palestinians of permanent displacement from their homeland. Several Arab countries, including Jordan and Egypt, echoed this sentiment by categorically opposing the relocation of Palestinians.Meanwhile, Israeli opinions remain divided. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich showed interest in exploring Trump's suggestion, while Prime Minister Netanyahu remains opposed. The situation exemplifies the intricate and longstanding geopolitical challenges in the region.",

            "description": "यदि आप राजस्थान में पर्यटन के लिए जाएंगे तो आपके अभिवादन के समय खम्मा घणी शब्द का उपयोग किया जाएगा। कुछ लोगों का मानना है कि खम्मा घणी का अर्थ होता है ' आपका स्वागत है' तो कुछ लोग मानते हैं कि खम्मा घणी यानी 'नमस्ते'। कुछ पर्यटकों को यह भी समझाया जाता है कि जब आम जनता अपने राजा का अभिवादन करती है तब खम्मा घणी शब्द का उपयोग किया जाता है। कुछ लोगों को लगता है कि जैसे उर्दू में अस्सलाम वालेकुम और वालेकुम अस्सलाम बोला जाता है ठीक उसी प्रकार राजस्थानी में खम्मा घणी और घणी खम्मा बोला जाता है। आइए जानते हैं कि उपरोक्त तीनों में से खम्मा घणी का सही अर्थ क्या है और क्या सचमुच तीनों में से कोई एक विकल्प सही है। खम्मा घणी शब्द का अर्थ है बार-बार क्षमा याचना करनाखम्मा घणी दो शब्दों से मिलकर बना है, खम्मा और घणी, यह क्षेत्रीय भाषा के शब्द है। खम्मा का अर्थ होता है 'क्षमा' और घणी का अर्थ होता है 'बहुत ज्यादा'। इस शब्द का उपयोग कभी भी किसी भी प्रकार के अभिवादन के लिए नहीं किया गया। राजस्थान के राजा रजवाड़े जब अपनी कुलदेवी की पूजा करते हैं तब खम्मा घणी शब्द का उपयोग किया जाता है। इसका अर्थ होता है कि यदि हमसे कोई भूल हुई है तो कृपया क्षमा करें। इस प्रकार खम्मा घणी शब्द का अर्थ हुआ बार-बार क्षमा याचना करना (Apologizing repeatedly)। खम्मा घणी शब्द का अर्थ है अभयदान मांगनाकालांतर में राजा की सेवक खम्मा घणी शब्द का उपयोग करने लगे। इसका तात्पर्य था, अपनी बात रखने से पहले राजा से क्षमादान मांग लेना। मुगलों का इतिहास हमने ज्यादा पढ़ा है। मुगल बादशाहों के सामने भी उनके सेवक इसी प्रकार से बात रखते थे ' यदि जान की सलामती हो तो अपनी बात कहूं...'। मुगलों से पूर्व भारतीय संस्कृति में राजाओं के सामने अपनी बात रखने से पहले अभयदान मांगने (to ask for amnesty) की परंपरा रही है। खम्मा घणी शब्द का अर्थ है विशेष प्रकार का सम्मान देनाअभय दान, जान की सलामती या फिर खम्मा घणी करते समय मांगने वाला व्यक्ति राजा के सामने नतमस्तक होता था। देखने वालों ने समझा कि इस प्रकार नतमस्तक होकर खम्मा घणी बोलना, राजा को विशेष प्रकार का सम्मान देते हुए उसका अभिवादन करना है। लोगों ने ऐसा करना शुरू कर दिया और धीरे-धीरे खम्मा घणी का पूरा अर्थ ही बदल गया। अब माना जाता है कि, कमर तक झुककर खम्मा घणी बोलने का मतलब है विशेष प्रकार का सम्मान (Special Respect) देना।",

            "description": "Trump's Bold Retaliatory Measures Against Colombia Test U.S.-LatAm Relations In a significant development in U.S.-Colombian relations, President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping retaliatory actions against Colombia on Sunday. The South American nation had refused to accept two U.S. military aircraft carrying deported migrants, part of Trump's aggressive crackdown on immigration.The measures include imposing a 25% tariff on Colombian imports, hiking to 50% within a week, along with a travel ban and visa revocations for Colombian officials. Trump emphasized that these are just initial steps, with further actions to be considered as necessary.This situation marks a pronounced shift towards a more muscular U.S. foreign policy under Trump's administration, highlighting a willingness to leverage economic and diplomatic pressure to achieve America's national security objectives.",

He urged the UK government to ensure that upcoming copyright reforms safeguard artists from unauthorized AI-generated content.McCartney's caution comes in the wake of challenges faced by the global music and film sectors regarding AI models that produce original outputs after being trained on existing works, often without compensating the original creators.In other news, Brazilians took to social media to celebrate the Oscar nominations for 'I'm Still Here,' directed by Walter Salles. The film, a collaboration between Brazil and France, received accolades for best picture, best international feature, and best actress for Fernanda Torres.",

Chouhan labeled Kejriwal as a 'Natwarlal' and questioned his intentions, drawing attention to the much-debated renovation of the Delhi CM's residence, termed 'Sheesh Mahal' by the BJP.Speaking at a rally in the Mundka constituency, Chouhan warned against falling prey to what he called Kejriwal's misleading promises. By likening him to a crafty hunter, the BJP leader accused Kejriwal of failing Delhi's farmers and alleged corrupt practices during his tenure.Chouhan outlined BJP's plans for Delhi, including legalizing unauthorized colonies and enhancing education and women's empowerment facilities. Highlighting the central government's schemes, he assured voters that the BJP would work for the welfare of all under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership.",

The incident raises safety concerns amidst heightened security measures for the national holiday.The theft occurred while Patnaik and his wife were asleep on the first floor, with security personnel stationed at the ground level. The second floor, where Patnaik's son resides, was vacant at the time of the burglary. CCTV footage captured the perpetrator entering the residence around 2:40 am and accessing a bedroom where the valuables were stored.Police have registered a case and launched an investigation into the incident. Political fallout from the robbery saw the Biju Janata Dal criticizing the Republican government for security lapses, while BJP spokesperson Manoj Mohapatra countered, citing inherited challenges. Despite assurances of swift action, the theft underscores broader public safety vulnerabilities.",

            "description": "Team India captain Rohit Sharma has received a heartwarming letter from his diehard 15-year-old fan after making his return to Ranji Trophy. The 37-year-old made his comeback to India’s premier domestic tournament after a gap of nine years for Mumbai's match against Jammu and Kashmir at the Sharad Pawar Cricket Academy Ground in Bandra-Kurla Complex, Mumbai on Thursday, January 23. Rohit was among the star Indian players alongside Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rishabh Pant, Shubman Gill and to name a few who have returned to play Ranji Trophy on the directions from BCCI selection committee and Team India head coach Gautam Gambhir following India’s disastrous Test of Australia, where senior players failed to perform in the 1-3 series defeat. Also read: Rohit Sharma returns to Ranji Trophy: How India captain performed in India's premier domestic tournament? However, Rohit Sharma didn’t have an ideal return to Ranji Trophy as he was dismissed for just three runs in Mumbai’s first innings batting. In the second innings, the Indian captain scored 28 runs. Mumbai suffered a shocking defeat at the hands of Jammu and Kashmir at their home ground. Many trolled Rohit Sharma for his horrible run of form in red-ball cricket. However, after the Ranji Trophy match, Rohit received a letter from the fan who came to watch him play at BKC and showed his admiration for the Team India captain. The letter went viral on social media. In a letter, fans stated that he is lucky to have been born in an era to watch his batting. He added that Rohit Sharma didn’t play a great innings in his Ranji Trophy but happy to see him getting back on the right track. “To my idol, my favourite player and the greatest batsman of all time. I know I will be representing millions of others as I say this, you are the reason I watch this beautiful sport and I am so lucky to be born in an era blessed to watch your elegant batting,\" a fan wrote in the letter. “Form is temporary, class is permanent. It doesn't matter, even if you haven't played a big innings recently; I can see that you are on the right track, and you will tear teams apart in the Champions Trophy. Your 3 sixes yesterday were amazing. I had to sit and watch the match during math class but it was worth it.” he added. Rohit Sharma recieved a beautiful letter from a 15-year-old fan after the Ranji trophy match 🤍 pic.twitter.com/bXYHalo1LH — Johns. (@CricCrazyJohns) January 26, 2025 Rohit Sharma is one of the greatest batters Indian cricket has ever produced. Ever since making his international debut for Team India in T20I, Rohit went on to cement his place in the team across all formats and became the captain of the national side in 2022 following Virat Kohli’s relinquishing the captaincy duties across all formats after the Test series defeat against South Africa. Recently Rohit Sharma came under heavy scrutiny following his disastrous batting in the Test series against Australia. He scored only 31 runs at an average of 6.2 in five innings. Due to poor form, Rohit opted out of the series decider in Sydney and handed over captaincy to Jasprit Bumrah. The fan further wrote that haters will continue to hate while hailing Rohit Sharma’s leadership as ‘top-notch’. He added that he has watched all the games just for the Team India captain and urged him not to retire, The fan also wrote that his dream is to become an cricket analyst while revealing that he is doing an internship with Rajasthan Royals. “Haters will hate but your leadership is top notch. You are the best character on the field and you have succeeded as both, a player and captain in EVERY SINGLE FORMAT. I've followed you forever and watch every game just for you.

Ahead of the upcoming game, Kohli trains intensively to sharpen his backfoot play.The former India captain's collaboration with Bangar highlights a long-standing trust in the coach's technical capabilities, a relationship forged between 2014 and 2019 during Kohli's peak years. This training comes amid directives from the BCCI for centrally-contracted players to participate in domestic cricket.Interest is building in Delhi, with DDCA readying Feroz Shah Kotla to accommodate up to 10,000 fans eager to see Kohli in action. While entry remains free, additional stands will be opened to cater to increased public excitement surrounding Kohli's performance.",

Instead of the usual rain, Oakville experienced a downpour of gelatinous blobs, a phenomenon now infamously known as the 'Oakville Blobs'.The Great Blob DownpourOn the morning of August 7, Oakville's residents woke up to find their town blanketed in tiny, translucent blobs, each about the size of a grain of rice. These gooey morsels fell in such abundance that they covered roofs and streets alike, peaking curiosity and concern among locals.Sunny Barclift, one of the first to report the phenomenon, described it as a scene straight out of a sci-fi movie — except this was all too real. The blobs didn’t just create a spectacle; they also seemed to carry a sinister undertone. Several residents reported flu-like symptoms after coming into contact with the goo, including dizziness and nausea.According to Discovery UK, she suspected her mother's sickness to be related to the blob rain and sent samples to the Hazardous Material Unit at the Department of Ecology of Washington State.Dotty Hearn, Barclift’s mother, even ended up hospitalized with severe inner ear issues shortly after the blobs fell. A local police officer who encountered the blobs while on patrol also fell ill.What Were The Oakville Blobs?As one might expect from such an unusual event, theories about the origin of the blobs ran rampant. Some locals speculated that they were remnants of military testing gone awry, especially given reports of military aircraft in the vicinity around that time. Others suggested more outlandish explanations involving extraterrestrial life and jellyfish being pulverised by sonic booms from nearby jets.Scientific investigations revealed that the blobs contained two species of bacteria. However, researchers found no evidence suggesting the bacteria were harmful. Some scientists proposed that the blobs could be related to \"star jelly\", a substance historically reported, but never definitively explained.Despite numerous attempts to unravel the mystery, the true nature of the Oakville Blobs remains elusive. Over three weeks in August 1994, there were six separate incidents where these gelatinous entities rained down on Oakville, yet no conclusive answers emerged. The samples collected for analysis were lost over time, leaving behind only questions.",

            "description": "The Republic Day parade at Kartavya Path on Sunday featured the Pralay missile, an indigenously developed short-range tactical missile, making its debut appearance. Designed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Pralay is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. This surface-to-surface missile can deliver payloads between 500 and 1,000 kilograms and has an effective range of 150 to 500 kilometers. The next on display on Kartavya Path is the Pralay Weapon System, Indigenously developed by RCI, DRDO, followed by Assam Rifles Marching Contingent, followed by Assam Rifles Band on the Kartavya Path, during the Republic Day Parade. #RepublicDayParade #76thRepublicDay... pic.twitter.com/bNTrz8KFfI — DD News (@DDNewslive) January 26, 2025 The parade also highlighted India’s growing defense capabilities, with a display of domestically developed missiles, surveillance systems, and advanced weaponry. DRDO showcased several groundbreaking innovations aimed at enhancing national security. Its tableau, themed 'Raksha Kavach — Multi-layer Protection against Multi-domain Threats,' featured a variety of advanced systems. These included the quick reaction surface-to-air missile, the airborne early warning and control system, the 155 mm/52 caliber advanced towed artillery gun system, and a system designed to detect, deter, and neutralize drones. The display also highlighted a satellite-based surveillance system, the medium-power radar Arudhra, an advanced lightweight torpedo, the electronic warfare system Dharashakti, a laser-based directed-energy weapon, and a very short-range air defense system. India celebrated its Republic Day by highlighting its cultural richness, progress, and military strength, with a special emphasis on 75 years since the Constitution came into effect. As part of the festivities, 31 tableaux paraded along Kartavya Path under the theme 'Swarnim Bharat: Virasat aur Vikas,' showcasing the nation's heritage and development.

22 वर्षों से मुसहर समुदाय के उत्थान के लिए काम करने के लिए भीम सिंह भवेश को पद्मश्री से सम्मानित किया जा रहा है। पीएम नरेंद्र मोदी ने \"मन की बात\" के 110वें एपिसोड में मुसहर समुदाय के उत्थान में डॉ. भवेश के प्रयासों की खूब सराहना की थी। वहीं, निर्मला देवी को पारंपरिक कढ़ाई के लिए पद्मश्री से सम्मानित किया जा रहा है। बम और गोलियों की बौछार के बीच से निकले सुशील मोदी 1992- 93 में पटना विश्वविद्यालय के ठीक सामने वाली सड़क रमना रोड पर बम के धमाके और गोलियां चलने की आवाज आई। सब जगह अफरा-तफरी मच गई। लोग घटनास्थल पर पहुंचे तो पता लगा कि वहां किसी व्यापारी की हत्या कर दी गई थी। उनके परिजनों से मिलने सुशील कुमार मोदी पीले रंग की वेस्पा 150 स्कूटर से उस इलाके से जा रहे थे। तभी अपराधियों ने पहले बम से हमला किया, फिर गोलियों की बौछार कर दी। उनके साथ उनके बॉडीगार्ड एक रिवाल्वर लिए पीछे की सीट पर बैठा था। हालांकि, इस घटना में सुशील कुमार मोदी को गोली नहीं लगी। लेकिन बम के दो चार स्प्रिंटर उन्हें लगे थे, जिससे वो घायल हो गए थे। इसके अलावा भी उन पर कई बार जानलेवा हमला किया गया। लाठी डंडों से पिटाई भी की गई। लेकिन सुशील कुमार मोदी ने राष्ट्रीय जनता दल और लालू यादव की सरकार के खिलाफ लड़ाई जारी रखी थी। पापा को गाना सुनाकर मायके से विदा हुईं थीं शारदा सिन्हा शारदा जी की शादी हुई। वह घर से विदा होने वाली थीं। गाड़ी तक आ गईं। पिता ने कहा, एक गीत सुनाकर जाओ। दुल्हन बनीं शारदा जी वापस घर में लौटी। आंगन में परिवार के लोग बैठे। शारदा जी ने गाना शुरू किया। समदौन और उदासी, दोनों मिलाकर। आंगन में बैठे परिजन, परिवारजन का विछोह राग के संग आंसू बन निकलता रहा। शारदा जी विदा हुईं। जब शारदा सिन्हा से मांग ली थी घूस शारदा सिन्हा एक बार बिहार के भ्रष्ट सिस्टम की शिकार हो गईं। कला संस्कृति विभाग में कार्यक्रम देने के बदले शारदा सिन्हा से अफसरों ने कमीशन की मांग की थी। उन्हें कमीशन देने से इनकार कर दिया। लोगों ने पूछा तो कहा कि मैं पैसा देकर कार्यक्रम नहीं ले सकती। उस समय विनय बिहारी कला संस्कृति विभाग के मंत्री थे। उन्होंने मंत्री रहते हुए कहा था कि हमारे विभाग में अफसरशाही इस तरह हावी हो गई है कि फेमस कलाकार से कमीशन की मांग की गई। विनय बिहारी ने सवाल उठाया तो मीडिया में भी खबरें आईं और सरकार की खूब किरकिरी हुई। विश्व के सबसे बड़े मंदिर का किशोर कुणाल करवा रहे थे निर्माण किशोर कुणाल अभी बिहार के पूर्वी चंपारण के केसरिया में अयोध्या की तरह विश्व के सबसे बड़े मंदिर भव्य विराट रामायण मंदिर का निर्माण करवा रहे थे। ये उनका ड्रीम प्रोजेक्ट था। इसके लिए वह कई साल से कार्य कर रहे थे। वर्ष 2027 तक मंदिर के तीन मंजिले भवन का निर्माण पूरा करना उनका लक्ष्य था, ताकि रामनवमी से लोग वहां स्थापित भगवान की प्रतिमा का दर्शन कर सके। उनके अनुसार उस मंदिर का आकर 1080 फीट लंबा और 540 फीट चौड़ा होगा। इसमें कुल 12 शिखर होंगे। वही मंदिर शिवलिंग स्थापित किया जाएगा वह 33 फीट ऊंचा और 33 फीट चौड़ा होगा। इसके अलावा सहस्त्र लिंगम में 1008 शिवलिंग होंगे। इस मंदिर को बनाने के लिए मजदूर 24 घंटा कार्य कर रहे हैं। यह मंदिर अब आकार भी लेने लगा है। विराट रामायण मंदिर का एक भव्य मॉडल किशोर कुणाल ने महावीर मंदिर में बनवा कर रखा है ताकि लोग उस मंदिर के बारे में जान सके। पिछले साल ही जून 2023 किशोर कुणाल मंदिर का नींव डालने के लिए केसरिया गए थे। वहां पर भव्य तरीके से पूजा पाठ करवा कर मंदिर का निर्माण कार्य शुरू करवाया था। करीब 500 करोड़ की लागत से इस मंदिर का निर्माण किया जा रहा है। भीम सिंह ने बच्चों को नामांकन कराया, लाइब्रेरी भी खोली भोजपुर के समाजसेवी डॉ. भीम सिंह भवेश ने करीब 8000 से ज्यादा मुसहर समुदाय के बच्चों का सरकारी स्कूलों में नामांकन करवाया और उन लोगों के लिए एक लाइब्रेरी भी खोली। भीम सिंह बच्चों को डॉक्यूमेंट और फॉर्म भरवाने में मदद करते हैं। भोजपुर और बक्सर जिले में इन्होंने 100 से ज्यादा मेडिकल कैंप लगाए और कोरोना काल में भी लोगों की काफी मदद की। 2024 में पटना में आयोजित कार्यक्रम में भारतीय क्रिकेट टीम के पूर्व कप्तान सौरव गांगुली ने भी भीम सिंह भवेश को सम्मानित किया था। निर्मला देवी ने 1000 से अधिक महिलाओं को प्रशिक्षित किया गायघाट थाना क्षेत्र के भुसरा गांव की निर्मला देवी को न सिर्फ सुजनी कलाकृति को जीवित रखा, बल्कि इसे देश भर के शहरी बाजारों और विश्व स्तर पर लोकप्रिय भी बनाया है। निर्मला ने सुजनी कढ़ाई में 15 से अधिक गांवों की 1000 से अधिक महिलाओं को प्रशिक्षित किया है। साथ ही आजीविका के लिए सक्षम बनाया है। मुजफ्फरपुर की सुजनी कढ़ाई को जीआई

            "description": "नशाखोरी कर अपराध करने वाले नाबालिग बदमाशों को अपराध से दूर करने के लिए पुलिस ने नई पहल की है। पुलिस घटना में नाबालिगों को पकड़ने के बाद उनके परिजन को थाने बुलाकर उन्हें कानूनी कार्रवाई की जानकारी दे रही है। माता-पिता को समझाया जा रहा है कि वे ही बच्चों को सुधारें। यदि वे ऐसा नहीं करते हैं और बालक फिर अपराध करता है तो माता-पिता पर बाउंड ओवर जैसी कार्रवाई होगी। पुलिस कमिश्नर संतोष कुमार सिंह ने बताया कि अधिकांश अपराधों में नाबालिग नशाखोरी के बाद अपराधों को अंजाम दे रहे हैं। ऐसे बालकों के माता-पिता को थाने बुलाकर काउंसलिंग की जा रही है। यदि पुलिस समझाइश से माता-पिता ही बालकों को अपराध से दूर कर लेते हैं तो वे खुद कानूनी कार्रवाई में नहीं फंसेंगे। यदि कोई बच्चा आदतन अपराधी हो गया है और नशे का आदी है तो परिजन पुलिस के माध्यम से उन्हें रिहेब सेंटर भेजकर सुधारने का प्रयास करेंगे। अपराध छोड़े, नौकरी करने लगेबाणगंगा, तुकोगंज, राजेंद्र नगर, लसूड़िया, एमआईजी, तिलक नगर, खजराना जैसे थानों के 30 से ज्यादा नाबालिगों को पुलिस ने काउंसलिंग कर नशे से दूर किया है। ये बात खुद इनके माता-पिता ने थाना प्रभारियों को बताई है। वहीं 4 अपराधी युवक नौकरी मिलने के बाद से अपराध से दूर होकर रोजाना काम पर जाने लगे हैं। पुलिस की समझाइश के बाद माता-पिता खुद इनकी मॉनिटरिंग कर रहे हैं। आर्थिक तंगी के कारण भी अपराध का रास्ता अपना लेते हैं। ऐसे 18 से 30 की उम्र के युवाओं के लिए सांवेर रोड इंडस्ट्री एरिया के उद्योगपतियों के माध्यम से फैक्टरियों में उनके हिसाब से काम व रोजगार दिलाकर उन्हें अपराध से दूर करने में भी पुलिस मदद कर रही है। जिन नाबालिगों की काउंसलिंग की है, उन परिवारों का हर महीने थाना प्रभारी फीड बैक भी जानेंगे। केस-1 नशे में कारें फोड़ीं, मजदूरी कर 20 हजार रु. चुकाने के निर्देशपुलिस की इस पहल का ताजा उदाहरण एमआईजी थाने का है। 19 जनवरी की रात साढ़े 11 बजे आरोपी करण भागोरे, निखिल जैन, निलेश गोयल, अजय मिश्रा और पुष्पेंद्र राजपूत ने नशे में प्रेस कॉम्प्लेक्स के पीछे व रेनेसा कॉलेज के पास गाड़ियों में तोड़फोड़ की घटना की थी। इन बदमाशों को एसीपी नरेंद्र रावत की टीम ने अगले ही दिन घरों से दबिश देकर गिरफ्तार किया। बदमाश 18 से 25 साल की उम्र के थे। इनके माता-पिता को पुलिस ने थाने बुलाया। एसीपी रावत ने उनकी काउंसलिंग की और माता-पिता के सामने बच्चों को आगे से अपराध करने पर बाउंड ओवर करने की बात कही। माता-पिता को समझाया कि बच्चों ने अब अपराध किया तो उन्हें कानूनी कार्रवाई का सामना करना पड़ेगा। आखिर में बदमाशों ने माफी मांगी तो उन्हें मजदूरी कर नुकसान की भरपाई के लिए 20 हजार रुपए चुकाने के निर्देश दिए। केस-2| नाबालिग को पकड़ा, परिजन बोले हम समझाएंगे 20 जनवरी को तड़के सुबह देवास से आए मजदूर युवक को अकेला देख क्षेत्र के दो नाबालिगों ने उसे धमकाकर 400 रुपए व उसका मोबाइल लूट लिया। घटना के बाद दोनों नाबालिगों को भंवरकुआं पुलिस ने शाम तक क्षेत्र से ही गिरफ्तार कर लिया। इनसे लूट के रुपए मोबाइल और अपराध में उपयोग की गई बाइक जब्त कर ली। इनके माता-पिता को घटना के बाद थाने बुलाकर लूट की गंभीर धाराओं में कार्रवाई, कोर्ट की प्रक्रिया और जेल भेजने पर बदमाशों के बीच रहने की पीड़ा को टीआई राजकुमार यादव ने समझाया। बाद में माता-पिता ने बच्चों को नियंत्रण में रखने का बोलकर माफी मांगी। आगे अपराध नहीं करने की समझाइश दी। पुलिस ने वैधानिक कार्रवाई के बाद बालकों को माता-पिता के हवाले किया।",

            "description": "ग्वालियर-चंबल के करीब 50 नर्सिंग कॉलेजों की मान्यता का मामला उलझ गया है। हाईकोर्ट ने स्पष्ट कर दिया है कि जिन कॉलेजों की सीबीआई जांच नहीं हुई, उन्हें कोई राहत नहीं दी जा सकती। हालांकि, याचिकाकर्ता कॉलेजों को सर्वोच्च न्यायालय से स्पष्टीकरण लाने की स्वतंत्रता दी गई है। हाईकोर्ट ने कहा कि वे उन्हीं कॉलेजों के मामले में विचार कर रहे हैं, जो सीबीआई जांच से गुजरे हैं। वह ऐसा कोई निर्देश देने के पक्ष में नहीं है, जिससे बिना सीबीआई जांच के कॉलेजों को मान्यता मिल सके। कॉलेजों ने कोर्ट में बताया कि उनकी जांच निरीक्षण डीएमई द्वारा बनाई कमेटी द्वारा की जा चुकी है। लेकिन कोर्ट ने कमेटी की रिपोर्ट को स्वीकार करने से इंकार कर दिया। अदालत ने याचिकाकर्ताओं को प्रस्ताव दिया था कि यदि वे कॉलेजों का सीबीआई निरीक्षण करवाने को तैयार हैं, तो सीबीआई की रिपोर्ट के आधार पर न्यायालय निर्णय ले सकता है। याचिकाकर्ताओं ने इसे अस्वीकार कर दिया, जिसके बाद कोर्ट ने मामले को खारिज कर दिया। हाईकोर्ट ने याचिकाकर्ताओं को सर्वोच्च न्यायालय का रुख करने की स्वतंत्रता दी है, ताकि वहां लंबित प्रकरण में स्पष्टीकरण प्राप्त किया जा सके। रजिस्ट्रार पर गंभीर आरोप याचिकाकर्ता विशाल बघेल ने हाईकोर्ट में आवेदन देकर तत्कालीन रजिस्ट्रार पर गंभीर आरोप लगाए हैं। उनका कहना है कि 2022-23 सत्र के दौरान कई नर्सिंग कॉलेजों में कोई भी छात्र प्रवेशित नहीं था। बावजूद इसके, सीबीआई रिपोर्ट को दरकिनार कर फर्जी तरीके से छात्रों के नामांकन के लिए पोर्टल खोला गया। आरोपों की गंभीरता को देखते हुए हाईकोर्ट ने नर्सिंग काउंसिल को निर्देश दिए हैं कि वे नामांकन से संबंधित सभी फाइलें कोर्ट में पेश करें। सीबीआई जांच में सामने आया कि कई नर्सिंग कॉलेजों में सत्र 2022-23 में एक भी छात्र का प्रवेश नहीं हुआ था। फिर भी इन कॉलेजों के सत्र 2022-23 के छात्रों के नामांकन के लिए अवैध तरीके से पोर्टल खोला गया।",

            "description": "FIITJEE, a prominent coaching institute, has denied voluntarily closing any of its centres amid reports of financial troubles and shutdowns across Delhi-NCR and north India. In a statement on Saturday, the institute attributed the situation to the abrupt exit of a Centre Managing Partner and staff, calling it a \"force majeure type of condition.\" “The present turmoil in the institution is temporary. Company officials are working to resume operations at all places within a reasonable time,” FIITJEE stated. The closure of centres in cities such as Noida, Ghaziabad, Meerut, and Bhopal has led to widespread protests from parents, many of whom have filed police complaints demanding a refund of fees, police officials said, as per news agency IANS. In South Delhi’s Kalu Sarai, near IIT-Delhi, classes were reportedly disrupted due to the alleged non-payment of teachers' salaries for several months, resulting in an exodus of faculty. According to news agency PTI, The founder of FIITJEE, along with 11 other individuals, was booked following a complaint filed by parents of students enrolled in the coaching institute’s Delhi-NCR branches. The Noida Police announced on Saturday that FIITJEE founder DK Goyal, Chief Financial Officer Rajiv Babbar, Chief Operating Officer Manish Anand, and the Greater Noida branch head Ramesh Batlesh had been named in the First Information Report (FIR).In response to over 250 accusations of fraudulent practices and mismanagement following the abrupt shutdown of FIITJEE’s East Delhi center, the Delhi Police initiated an investigation, PTI cited sources as informing.ALSO READ | Republic Day Quiz: Answer These 25 Questions To Test You Knowledge About IndiaFIITJEE Alleges 'Criminal Conspiracy' Amid Police CasesFIITJEE maintained that it is taking legal action against criminal cases filed against the institute, alleging that the controversy is part of a “criminal conspiracy” by vested interests. “This entire story is part of a criminal conspiracy which has been hatched by people with vested interests and very soon, through a detailed investigation, the truth will emerge. Truth cannot be concealed forever,” the statement read. The coaching institute also warned of legal action against competitors, accusing them of engaging in “unfair trade practices” and stating that it would pursue the matter in both civil and criminal courts. FIITJEE, which operates 72 centres across 41 cities and employs over 300 people, blamed its financial difficulties on mismanagement by its Managing Partners. According to the statement, the Corporate Office in Delhi merely followed the advice of these partners to grow the business, but they allegedly misused their authority, leading to significant losses. “Managing Partners have a profit-sharing model besides getting a regular salary. They have been receiving regular MIS by email since 2014-15 to this effect. They compelled the corporate management to usurp the entire collections, causing significant losses,” FIITJEE claimed. The company noted that its financial distress became apparent in January 2024, prompting its Chief Financial Officer to warn that an operational cash crunch could arise within six months. By February 2024, the Core Group and Managing Partners were asked to optimise staff, improve work culture, and strategise a financial recovery, FIITJEE stated. “These discussions took place through recorded Zoom meetings and written communications, but most Managing Partners did not take any action,” the company asserted. Instead, it accused some partners of exploiting the crisis for personal gain, saying, “Rather than working on proper optimisation, they halted admissions and disrupted regular processes. This exacerbated the financial crunch.” A police complaint was filed in Noida’s Sector-58 on Thursday over the sudden closure of the FIITJEE centre there without refunds. Similar complaints have surfaced in multiple locations across north India, as per IANS.",
