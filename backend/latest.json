            "description": "Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) star batter Virat Kohli could not contain his happiness as the team ended 17-year winless drought against Chennai Super Kings (CSK) at their rivals fortress, Chepauk Stadium on Friday, March 29. Royal Challengers Bengaluru registered a 50-run win over Chennai Super Kings to put an end to their winless streak at the Chepauk. The last time RCB won the match against CSK in Chennai was in 2008, defeating their rivals by 14 runs. After posting a total of 196/8, thanks to fifty by skipper Rajat Patidar and Tim David’s late cameo knock, RCB restricted to 146/8 in 20 overs. Josh Hazlewood led the bowling attack with figures of 3/21, while Yash Dayal and Liam Livingstone picked two wickets. Also read: IPL 2025: Hazlewood hails RCB's adaptability, praises Yash Dayal after dominant win over CSK Royal Challengers Bengaluru players were ecstatic as they finally invaded Chennai Super Kings’ fortress after 17 long years. Virat Kohli was the happiest among them as he became the first RCB player to be part of two wins against Chennai Super Kings at Chepauk. In a video posted by RCB on its social media handles, Kohli and his teammates can be seen grooving to Hanumankind’s blockbuster album ‘Run it up’ to celebrate the team’s Chepauk breach. WATCH: Virat Kohli dancing in dressing room A win so special, it got King Kohli grooving... 😍 This team! The vibes! We’re loving it. ❤ 🎧: Hanumankind (Run it Up)#PlayBold #ನಮ್ಮRCB #IPL2025 #CSKvRCB pic.twitter.com/qmjASYMVFf — Royal Challengers Bengaluru (@RCBTweets) March 29, 2025 Chasing a 197-run target, Chennai Super Kings suffered early blows as they lost four wickets for 54 runs in 8.5 overs. Rachin Ravindra stood tall for the side as he played a valiant innings of 41 off 31 balls to stabilize the CSK’s batting. Yash Dayal inflicted further damage on the hosts’ batting as he picked two wickets of Rachin and Shivam Dube (19) in the 13th over. After Chennai Super Kings were reduced to 99/7 after Ravichandran Ashwin’s dismissal, MS Dhoni walked out to bat. However, it was too late as CSK needed 98 off 28 balls to win the match. However, Dhoni’s late cameo unbeaten knock of 30 off 16 balls, smashing two sixes and a four reduced the margin of defeat, but it was not enough as RCB sealed historic 50-run victory at Chepauk. Virat Kohli’s performance in IPL 2025 Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) star batter Virat Kohli had a great start to his IPL 2025 campaign as he played a match-winning innings of 59 off 36 balls to help the team chase down the 175-run target set by the defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders in the season opener at the Eden Gardens Stadium in Kolkata. However, in the second match against Chennai Super Kings, the 36-year-old struggled to get on on a spin track. He was struggling to play against spin and pace as he scored a scratchy 31 off 30 balls before he was dismissed by Nood Ahmad. Kohli’s performance with the bat on a traditional spin surface at Chepauk raised concerns about his ability to accelerate against quality spin bowling. In IPL 2025 so far, Virat Kohli has aggregated 90 runs, including a fifty, at an average of 90 in two matches. Kohli will look to come up with goods when Royal Challengers Bengaluru take on Gujarat Titans at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on April 2.

According to reports, primordial black holes that existed in the early universe could have evaporated through Hawking radiation, impacting matter distribution. The research explores how these black holes might have shaped galaxies and cosmic structures. Although no direct evidence has been found, scientists believe future observations could confirm their role in cosmology and particle physics.",

The victims from the country's north were killed in the Uromi area of Edo State after being stopped by local security personnel. During a search of their vehicle, officers discovered locally made weapons, and that triggered the attack by the mob, Edo police spokesperson Moses Yamu said in a statement. Videos shared on social media showed the victims being brutalized before they were eventually set on fire with worn-out vehicle tires.",

            "description": "पूर्वांचल...20 से ज्यादा जिलों का समूह। जब भी इसकी बात होती है, आंखों के सामने बाहुबली, गैंगस्टर और माफिया घूमने लगते हैं। एक से बढ़कर एक अपराधी और उनका ऊंचा सियासी कद। मर्डर ऐसे हुए कि विधायक के शरीर को गोलियों से भर दिया गया। फिलहाल, आतंक का यह चैप्टर बंद हो गया। वर्चस्व की लड़ाई खत्म हो गई है। नई पीढ़ी माफियागीरी को साइड रखकर सियासत में उतरी है। अब सवाल है...पूर्वांचल की जो सियासत कभी गाजीपुर और मऊ से चलती थी, उसका सेंटर अब कहां है? आज इस पर बात इसलिए, क्योंकि मुख्तार अंसारी की मौत को एक साल हो गए हैं। क्या कुछ बदल गया? किसका उभार हुआ, किसका पतन। सियासत किस करवट बैठ रही? आज इन्हीं सवालों के जवाब जानेंगे। पहले थोड़ा पीछे चलते हैं, फिर आज की बात और आखिर में भविष्य की बात करेंगे... पूर्वांचल के विकास की योजनाओं ने बाहुबली जन्मे 1970 के दशक में केंद्र सरकार और यूपी सरकार ने पूर्वांचल के विकास के लिए तमाम योजनाएं शुरू कीं। योजनाएं आईं तो ठेकेदार भी आए। ठेकेदारी के साथ दबंगई भी आई। जो जितना अधिक दबंग, उसे उतना ज्यादा मलाईदार ठेका। इन्हीं ठेकों के लिए संघर्ष शुरू हुआ। उन दिनों पूर्वांचल में दो गैंग थे। एक मकनु सिंह गैंग और दूसरा साहिब सिंह गैंग। मुख्तार अंसारी अपने कॉलेज के दोस्त साधु सिंह के साथ मकनु सिंह गैंग में शामिल हुए। पूर्वांचल में बाहुबलियों का नाम आता है, तो ब्रजेश सिंह का भी जिक्र होता है। ब्रजेश उस वक्त साहिब सिंह गैंग में थे। मुख्तार और ब्रजेश में किसी तरह का कोई आपसी विवाद नहीं था, लेकिन गैंग के चलते दोनों ने एक-दूसरे को दुश्मन माना और 1990 आते-आते दोनों एक दूसरे के जानी दुश्मन बन गए। इसी दौरान ब्रजेश की गैंग में त्रिभुवन सिंह शामिल हुआ। त्रिभुवन मुख्तार का दुश्मन हुआ करता था। दोनों मिले तो गैंग में वर्चस्व की लड़ाई शुरू हुई। ठेका रेलवे के स्क्रैप का हो, शराब का हो या फिर कोई किडनैपिंग का मामला। दोनों गैंग हमेशा एक दूसरे के सामने आ जाते। दो मामले जहां मुख्तार और ब्रजेश की दुश्मनी कट्टर हो गई गैंगवार के बाद चुनावी जंग शुरू हुई 90 के दशक में यूपी की राजनीति में स्थिरता नहीं थी। सपा-बसपा और बीजेपी बराबर पर खड़े थे। कांग्रेस पिछड़ रही थी। उस वक्त मुख्तार अंसारी ने बसपा जॉइन की और मऊ सीट पर बीजेपी के विजय प्रताप सिंह को 26 हजार वोट से हराकर विधायक बन गया। इस जीत के बाद मुख्तार की शक्ति और संपत्ति दोनों में इजाफा हो गया। विधायक बनने के बाद ठेका लेने और दिलवाने में दिक्कत खत्म हो गई। मुख्तार गैंगस्टर से रॉबिनहुड बनने की तरफ बढ़ गया। किसी की बेटी की शादी हो, किसी की तेरहवीं हो, मुख्तार के फाटक पर पहुंचो और पैसा लेकर जाओ। मुख्तार अंसारी का जहां घर है, वह गाजीपुर की मोहम्मदाबाद सीट लगती है। यहां पर 1985 से ही अंसारी परिवार का कब्जा रहा है। आज भी है। 2002 में बीजेपी नेता कृष्णानंद राय ने मुख्तार के बड़े भाई अफजाल अंसारी को 7 हजार 7 सौ 72 वोट से हरा दिया। 25 नवंबर 2005 को कृष्णानंद राय की गाड़ी पर हमला हो गया। हमला AK-47 से हुआ। कृष्णानंद राय समेत कुल 7 लोग मारे गए। पोस्टमॉर्टम हुआ तो सातों के शरीर से 67 गोलियां मिलीं। कृष्णानंद राय की गाड़ी के पीछे वाली गाड़ी पर बैठे उनके भाई रामनारायण राय कहते हैं, मारने वाले कह रहे थे, ‘मारो इसको, इन लोगों ने भाई को बहुत परेशान कर रखा है।’ लोग बताते हैं कि ये भाई कोई और नहीं बल्कि मुख्तार अंसारी था। कृष्णानंद की पत्नी अलका राय ने मुख्तार अंसारी, अफजाल अंसारी, अतहर रहमान उर्फ बाबू, मुन्ना बजरंगी, संजीव महेश्वरी उर्फ जीवा के खिलाफ मामला दर्ज किया। उस वक्त मुख्तार का खौफ ऐसा था कि एसपी ने जांच करने से मना कर दिया था। कोई जेल में तो कोई कोर्ट में मारा गया पूर्वांचल में अंसारी परिवार के दबदबे को कुछ ऐसे समझिए...। अलका चाहती थीं कि उनके पति की हत्या का केस सीबीआई देखे। सीबीआई यह केस नहीं लेना चाहती थी। दबाव बढ़ा तो ले लिया, लेकिन एक साल बाद ही छोड़ दिया। अलका ने दोबारा मामला दर्ज करवाया। उसी दौरान चश्मदीद शशिकांत राय की हत्या कर दी गई। 2005 में ‘ए’ कैटेगरी के बड़े ठेकेदार अजय प्रकाश सिंह उर्फ मन्ना की हत्या हुई। इस मामले के चश्मदीद मन्ना के मुनीम राम सिंह मौर्य को सुरक्षा मिली। एक साल बाद राम सिंह और उनके गनर को भी गोली मारकर मौत के घाट उतार दिया गया। इन घटनाओं से लोगों के मन में डर बैठ गया। मुख्तार ने अपना ठिकाना जेल को बनाया। इसलिए कई केसों में उसका नाम डायरेक्ट नहीं आया। 2017 में जब बीजेपी की सरकार बनी तो चीजें बदल गईं। डॉन मुन्ना बजरंगी की बागपत जेल में हत्या हो गई। संजीव महेश्वरी उर्फ जीवा की कोर्ट में हत्या कर दी गई और 2024 में मुख्तार अंसारी की बांदा जेल में मौत हो गई। इस तरह से पूर्वांचल की सियासत में क्राइम का एक चैप्टर खत्म हो गया। पूर्वांचल में अब ब्रजेश सिंह का दबदबा इन तीन तस्वीरों में देखिए ब्रजेश सिंह का रसूख मुख्तार की मौत के पहले तक पूर्वांचल की सियासत में बाहुबली ब्रजेश सिंह पर्दे के पीछे रहते थे, वह अब आगे आ गए हैं। इसकी पहली बानगी उनके बेटे की शादी में दिखती है। इसी मार्च महीने में ब्रजेश ने अपने छोटे बेटे सागर सिंह की शादी की। शादी गोवा में हुई और उसका रिसेप्शन बनारस में हुआ। इस रिसेप्शन में आसपास के जितने बाहुबली नेता थे, सभी पहुंचे। इसमें ब्रजभूषण सिंह, धनंजय सिंह, रघुराज प्रताप सिंह भी शामिल रहे। यूपी सरकार के डिप्टी सीएम ब्रजेश पाठक समेत करीब 10 से ज्यादा मंत्री और 20 से ज्यादा विधायक रिसेप्शन में शामिल हुए। ऐसा नहीं कि ब्रजेश सिंह का राजनीतिक रसूख पहले नहीं था। ब्रजेश के बड़े भाई उदय सिंह उर्फ चुलबुल सिंह दो बार एमएलसी रह चुके हैं। भतीजे सुशील सिंह इस वक्त विधायक हैं। सुशील की पत्नी और भाई जिला पंचायत अध्यक्ष रह चुके हैं। ब्रजेश खुद भी 2016 में निर्दलीय जीते। उस वक्त बीजेपी ने समर्थन किया तो उसकी बड़ी आलोचना हुई थी। इसी वजह से 2022 में ब्रजेश की पत्नी अन्नपूर्णा सिंह जब प्रत्याशी बनीं तो उनके सामने बीजेपी ने सुदामा पटेल को प्रत्याशी बनाया। लेकिन जीत अन्नपूर्णा की हुई। बीजेपी का समर्थन प्राप्त हमने पॉलिटिकल एक्सपर्ट मुलायम सिंह यादव से पूर्वांचल की राजनीति को लेकर बात की। वह 2022 के एमएलसी चुनाव से ही बात की शुरुआत करते हैं। कहते हैं, यूपी में 36 सीटों पर चुनाव हुआ। 33 बीजेपी जीती। जिन तीन जगहों पर हारी, वहां बीजेपी ने खुद अपने कैंडिडेट को हरवाया। वाराणसी में ब्रजेश की पत्नी को 4234 वोट मिले और बीजेपी को मात्र 170 वोट। यह कैसे हो सकता है। स्वाभाविक है कि बीजेपी के वोटर्स यहां दूसरी तरफ गए हैं। मुलायम सिंह यादव कहते हैं, धनंजय सिंह की पत्नी पिछले साल लोकसभा चुनाव में जौनपुर सीट से बीजेपी प्रत्याशी बनीं, फिर अचानक वापस हो गईं। पार्टी में एकजुटता भले न हो, लेकिन पूर्वांचल में ठाकुर जाति में एकजुटता बहुत है। सरकार की नीतियों ने पूर्वांचल को बदला पूर्वांचल की राजनीति में बदलाव को लेकर हमने वाराणसी में बीएचयू के प्रोफेसर तेज प्रताप सिंह से बात की। वह कहते हैं, आज स्थिति यह है कि खुलेआम न तो किसी की किडनैपिंग हो रही और न ही किसी से वसूली मांगी जा रही। प्रशासन और कानून अपने स्तर पर मजबूत हुए हैं। तेज प्रताप सिंह मौजूदा स्थिति को लेकर बिना किसी का नाम लिए कहते हैं, ‘आज जो पूर्वांचल की राजनीति में केंद्र में हैं, वह भी अब न किसी की किडनैपिंग कर रहे और न ही किसी को धमकाकर पैसा मांग रहे। वह लोग तो अब खबरों से भी गायब रहना ठीक समझते हैं। अब गैंग भी नहीं कि एक दूसरे के गैंग पर हमला किया जाए। मैं फिर से कह रहा हूं कि प्रशासन स्तर पर अच्छा काम हुआ, जिसकी वजह से चीजें बदल रही हैं।’ जातियों में बंटा है पूरा क्षेत्र हम पूर्वांचल के अलग-अलग जिलों में तीन दिन रहे। हमें गाजीपुर में पूर्वांचल एक्सप्रेस-वे के पास किसान मनोहर राय मिले। वह कहते हैं, यहां जाति सबसे महत्वपूर्ण है। जैसे मैं भूमिहार जाति का हूं और बीजेपी का समर्थक हूं तो मेरी जाति के खिलाफ वाले लोग दूसरी पार्टी में चले जाएंगे। क्योंकि उन्हें लोकल स्तर पर दुश्मनी निभानी है। उसे उन्हें डाउन करना है। यह सिर्फ गाजीपुर में नहीं है, हम बलिया से हैं, वहां भी यही स्थिति है। लोकसभा चुनाव में सपा से सनातन पांडेय के आ जाने से लोग जातियों में ही बंट गए। हमें कारोबारी मयंक कुमार राय मिले। वह कहते हैं, पूर्वांचल की राजनीति में गुंडाराज खत्म हो गया है। विकास का मुद्दा सबसे आगे है। जहां तक ब्रजेश सिंह की बात है तो उनका इलाका बनारस है, गाजीपुर की जनता अपने मन से आगे बढ़ती है। वह किसी की नहीं सुनती। बाकी जातिवाद तो यहां खूब है, मुख्तार अंसारी का परिवार यहां इसलिए जीत रहा था, क्योंकि यादव-मुस्लिम एक जुट होकर उनके साथ रहते थे। बसपा ने इस साल उमेश सिंह को प्रत्याशी बनाया था। बहुत अच्छे नेता हैं, लेकिन जातिवाद के चलते नहीं जीत पाए। -------------------- ये खबर भी पढ़ें... यूपी का पहला डिजिटल हाईवे कैसा

For such an anticipated project, Nintendo chose the most low-key way of announcing the date: via their new Nintendo Today news app. They did just have a Nintendo Direct yesterday, which did not contain any mention of the movie, and they also have a Switch 2-focused Direct next week; both of those would have more obvious options to drop the news. Elsewhere in games, Ubisoft and Tencent have formed a new subsidiary company that will handle some of Ubi's big IPs like Far Cry, Rainbow Six, and Assassin's Creed. And finally, new Sims challenger InZOI is still in early access, and players have already found a bug that will let you run over children with a car. Yes, it's already patched.",

            "description": "Presidential Pardon: Trump Commutes Sentence of Ozy Media Co-founder In a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump commuted the sentence of Ozy Media co-founder Carlos Watson just before he was due to begin a nearly 10-year prison term for financial conspiracy.Watson's conviction last year was a headline-grabbing case that highlighted the dramatic downfall of the ambitious media startup. A senior White House official confirmed the commutation under conditions of anonymity.Breon Peace, the former Brooklyn-based U.S. attorney, stated after the trial that Watson had deceived investors by lying repeatedly to sell stock in his company. According to Peace, Ozy Media ultimately collapsed due to Watson's dishonest practices. The commutation reflects Trump's ongoing use of presidential powers to address cases he perceives as unjust.",

These rulings challenged earlier determinations by judges Rudolph Contreras and Beryl Howell, who had previously impeded Trump's actions.The Justice Department is currently appealing the initial decisions, which could impact the landscape of appointment authority. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden had appointed Harris in 2021 and re-nominated Wilcox for a second term in 2023, spotlighting ongoing tensions in the governance of labor relations.",

Bilal and Suraj Prakash stand accused of issuing fake MBBS and BAMS degrees, with authorities uncovering digital and material evidence connected to their operation.The investigation commenced following a complaint from Arpit Jain, who claimed Suraj Prakash defrauded him of Rs 5.8 lakh by promising a medical degree admission in Romania. Instead, Jain received a counterfeit certificate, prompting police action.During the probe, officers seized forged documents from Chaudhary Charan Singh University and discovered extensive data on fraudulent activities through digital devices. The two allegedly charged hefty fees for the fake certificates, targeting students online. Another suspect, Abhishek Yadav, has been implicated as the investigation deepens.",

Despite pressure from Washington, Zelenskiy emphasized that the proposal requires careful examination to ensure it doesn't compromise the nation's interests.The revised U.S. draft reportedly demands Ukraine surrender all profit from its resources until American wartime assistance, along with interest, is repaid. This contentious stipulation has elicited caution from Kyiv, which insists on inspecting the terms thoroughly. Zelenskiy refrained from passing immediate judgment on the proposal, indicating that legal review is crucial.Ukraine faces a delicate diplomatic crossroads, with the potential deal lacking future security assurances and demanding significant Ukrainian financial concessions. Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko urged restraint in public dialogue, noting that consensus must precede any official stance on the proposal.",

            "description": "Devastating Earthquake Ravages Myanmar, Killing Over 140 A deadly earthquake in Myanmar has claimed the lives of more than 140 people, collapsing buildings and leaving a trail of devastation in its wake across the region. The 7.7 magnitude quake struck near Mandalay, toppling infrastructure and triggering aftershocks that worsened the disaster's impact.General Min Aung Hlaing, head of Myanmar's military junta, anticipates further casualties and has appealed for international aid. U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed America would extend some form of assistance. The earthquake's timing compounds challenges facing Myanmar, as it grapples with political instability and ongoing insurgencies.Rescue operations are severely hampered due to the country's political chaos and lack of resources, as residents and emergency workers struggle in the quake's aftermath. The international community, including the United Nations, is mobilizing to support Myanmar, though effective communication remains an obstacle amidst governmental turmoil.",

Authorities revealed that the couple, identified as Rajkumar, 65, and his wife Gita, 62, consumed a toxic substance, leading to their tragic demise.Local police, led by Station House Officer Rajiv Sharma, have launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the deaths. Neighbors disclosed that the couple faced mounting financial difficulties and struggled to afford Rajkumar's medical treatment, allegedly exacerbated by their son's refusal to provide financial aid.In a separate yet similarly devastating incident, a 25-year-old man named Vikas from Sikanderpur village also succumbed to an alleged suicide by ingesting poison. Despite being rushed to a hospital, Vikas was declared dead upon arrival. Investigations aimed at revealing his motives remain ongoing.",

            "description": "New Delhi, Mar 28 (PTI) Several Muslims, including MPs and MLAs, wore black armbands while attending Jumma prayers on the last Friday of Ramzan as a mark of protest against the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) claimed.The AIMPLB had earlier urged Muslims to wear a black armband when they go for Jumma prayers on the last Friday of Ramzan as a mark of their protest against the Waqf (Amendment) Bill.AIMPLB president Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani, general secretary Maulana Fazlurraheem Mujaddidi, vice president Syed Sadatullah Hussaini, and secretary Maulana Umrain Mahfooz Rahmani, among others, wore black armbands.AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, IUML MP Kani Navas, Congress MP Imran Masood, Karnataka Assembly MLA Rizwan Arshad, were among the lawmakers, who sported the armband while praying Jumma in the mosques they offered prayers at.\"Today, on the last Friday of Ramadan, i.e. Juma-tul-Vida, crores of Indian Muslims tied black bands on their hands and registered peaceful protest against the Waqf Amendment Bill 2024. Muslims reject this bill!\" the AIMPLB claimed in a post on X.\"We demand the government to immediately withdraw this unconstitutional Waqf Amendment Bill!\" it said.A large number of Muslims in Patna and other cities also wore black armbands during Jumma prayers on the last Friday of Ramzan in protest against the Waqf (Amendment) Bill.Several Muslims posted pictures of themselves wearing the armband on social media as directed by the AIMPLB with the hashtag 'India Against Waqf Bill'.The AIMPLB on Sunday announced a nationwide agitation against the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, with large sit-ins planned in front of the state assemblies in Patna and Vijayawada on March 26 and 29, respectively, as part of the first phase of the protest.The protests against the Waqf Bill rocked Bihar on Wednesday, from the legislature to the streets, as political parties within the state and outside stood in solidarity with the AIMPLB, which organised a 'maha dharna' in Patna.The AIMPLB demonstrations were held barely a kilometre away from the Vidhan Sabha premises, to demand rollback of the Bill brought by the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and to request \"secular\" leaders like Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to reconsider \"support\" to the contentious legislation.The AIMPLB's 31-member Action Committee has resolved to adopt all constitutional, legal and democratic means to oppose the bill, which it has described as \"controversial, discriminatory and damaging\".Major rallies are scheduled to be held in Hyderabad, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Malerkotla (Punjab) and Ranchi, the AIMPLB had said in a statement.The AIMPLB's statement comes after Parliament's joint committee submitted its report on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill. Though not listed yet, there is speculation that the proposed legislation could be brought for passage in Parliament during the ongoing Budget Session.The 31-member panel on the Bill, after multiple sittings and hearings, suggested several amendments to the proposed legislation even as the opposition members disagreed with the report and submitted dissent notes.The 655-page report was submitted to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on January 30.The joint committee adopted the report that contained changes suggested by members of the ruling BJP by a 15-11 majority vote. The move prompted the opposition to dub the exercise an attempt to destroy Waqf boards.The Bill was referred to the joint committee on August 8 last year following its introduction in the Lok Sabha by Union Minority Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju.

Despite a 0.8% rise in personal income, consumer spending grew just 0.4%, below the forecasted 0.5%. The saving rate also climbed to 4.6%, reflecting growing caution among consumers. Rising goods and services prices, coupled with concerns over President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, add uncertainty to the inflation outlook. With inflation above the Fed’s target, any rate cuts may now be delayed, leaving markets and consumers on edge.",

            "description": "Delhi High Court Rules Against Compulsory Service Charges in Restaurants The Delhi High Court has ruled that service charges on food bills in restaurants are voluntary, dismissing petitions from industry bodies challenging Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) guidelines. This decision marks a significant win for consumer rights, ensuring customers are not obligated to pay service charges.Justice Prathiba M Singh's judgment emphasized that mandatory service charges mislead consumers, suggesting unfair trade practices by equating them with GST or service tax. The court rebuked the Federation of Hotels and Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) and the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), imposing a Rs 1 lakh penalty on each for ignoring consumer welfare.The CCPA guidelines were initially stayed in 2022 but have now been upheld as the court affirmed the authority's role in curbing unfair practices. While restaurants argued service charges benefited staff, the court found no supporting evidence. This verdict underscores the precedence of consumer rights over commercial interests in trade practices.",

The announcement comes amid controversy over an alleged discovery of substantial cash at his official residence.The Law Ministry's notification follows a recommendation from the Supreme Court Collegium, which insists that the transfer is unrelated to the ongoing in-house investigation prompted by the alleged cash find.Despite the severe allegations, Justice Varma has denied any wrongdoing, dismissing the claims of money discovery as a baseless conspiracy intended to tarnish his reputation.",

            "description": "SHANGHAI, March 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- \"For today's speech, I implanted the speech script into my glasses.\" Eric Li, chairman of Geely Holding Group and founder of DreamSmart, said with a smile at the 2025 Shanghai Global Investment Promotion Conference held on March 25th. As a leading figure in China's tech and automobile industry, Eric Li's appearance is particularly striking - he wore a pair of StarV Air2 smart glasses on stage, the whole \"off-script\" speech. The glasses not only project the speech in real time on the lenses, but also synchronize the content according to the speed of speech. The glasses come from none other than Geely eco-company Meizu. As a technology company, Meizu has redefined the future of interaction with AR+AI technology, and Geely has the next generation of human-machine interaction products. As a key platform to promote the construction of Shanghai's \"five centers\", this year's Shanghai Global Investment Promotion Conference attracted more than 500 domestic and foreign well-known enterprises, investment institutions and representatives of business associations gathered together. the first four sessions have contributed to the signing of more than 580 major projects, with a total investment of more than 1.1 trillion yuan. In this stage for global enterprises to share opportunities, Eric Li attracted the attention of global investors with a technological speech, showing Meizu's innovative strength and product charm. From the perspective of the conference as a whole, the \"newness\" of this scene is far more than just a display of technology, but also reflects the courage and confidence of entrepreneurs to physically promote the development of science and technology. Eric Li's AR glasses and Shanghai has an inextricable link. \"I'm wearing this pair of smart AR glasses today, the core technology research and development team and the core supply chain are in Shanghai, has been mass-produced for two generations and has been verified by tens of thousands of consumers.\" Meizu's deep cooperation with the industry's TOP-level supply chain partners has resulted in the debut and first use of many industry-leading products, leading the development trend of the smart glasses industry. StarV Air2 has been mass-produced and optimized through two generations of products, serving more than 50,000 users cumulatively, and is a phenomenal product in the AR field. In addition to supporting the teleprompter function that has recently flamed out of the circle.It also supports AI real-time translation, AR navigation, AI meeting assistant and other functions. StarVee Phantom researches its own Flyme AI big model, and in addition to accessing the head third party big model such as Tongyi Thousand Questions, Byte Beanbag, and Wenxin Yiyin, it is also the first to access the DeepSeek big model, and is actively building a comprehensive AI ecosystem. StarV Air2 adopts a highly difficult optical waveguide program, and after two generations of iteration, the product power is leading generation to generation. Not long ago, iResearch released the \"2024 Consumer AR Glasses Market Report\", which researched the five most powerful companies in the smart glasses industry and put forward the concept of \"Five AR Glasses Giants\", with Meizu at the top of this. The iResearch also pointed out that in the first quarter since the release of the StarV series of products in September last year, the market share quickly reached 41.5%, and the sales volume in the AR category was the first in the country, directly pulling the industry sales growth. Meizu is the only enterprise with a full ecological layout in the AR glasses industry. As an important part of Meizu's \"smart phone + XR + smart car\" business layout, AR smart glasses can be interconnected with smartphones, smart cars and other terminals through Flyme AIOS, and jointly build a multi-terminal, full-scene, immersive and integrated experience for consumers. Meizu's convergent AI ecology has been widely welcomed by users, and the results of the ecological layout have been initially seen: in 2025, Meizu has won \"three firsts in China\" - the first in the sales growth rate of AI cell phones, the first in the market share of smart glasses, and the first in the number of listed models and the first in the growth rate of users in a single month of the intelligent cockpit operating system, and has covered more than 600,000 car owner users. Flyme Auto is the first in the number of listed models and the first in the growth rate of users in a single month, and it has already covered more than 600,000 car owners and users, and is firmly in the first camp of the automobile system. It's worth to mention that Meizu is the smartphone brand of DreamSmart Group, which carries AI eco-products in three product areas, which are smartphones, XR and smart cars. With deep technological expertise in multiple industries, DreamSmart is recognized as a leader in smart ecosystems. Meizu took the lead in proposing the \"All in AI\" strategy at the beginning of 2024, and has made every effort to promote the application of AI at the product level, bringing users a brand-new integration experience. Looking ahead, Meizu's practicality, innovation and leadership in application scenarios will paint a new picture of the global smart mobility ecosystem.",

The nation is teetering on the brink of conflict as President Salva Kiir and First Vice President Riek Machar's rift deepens, threatening to undo the 2018 peace pact.Stalled provisions of the peace agreement, including elections and force unification, have fueled unrest. The detention of Machar has raised concerns, with the UN warning of a potential slide back into civil war. Accusations fly over the White Army's involvement in recent clashes, as both sides face scrutiny.Regional leaders are engaged, with Kenyan President William Ruto and other East African officials working to de-escalate the situation. As Odinga prepares to visit Juba, hopes are pinned on diplomatic intervention to prevent further bloodshed in a region already scarred by years of conflict.",

Duffy took as many as 13 wickets in the series, which is the joint most for New Zealand as he equalled leg-spinner Ish Sodhi's feat, which he achieved against Australia at home in 2021. Even though Tim Seifert was named the Player of the Series for scoring 249 runs in five matches, including an unbeaten 97 off just 38 balls, Duffy played a massive part in New Zealand's win.",

Although authorities have not yet provided an official statement, sources indicate that among the fallen officers, one was a selection grade constable. Both officers were reportedly personal security officers (PSOs) assigned to the SDPO Border. The militants, estimated to be around six in number, are suspected to have recently infiltrated from across the Pakistan border. They were first seen by a local couple on Sunday evening in the forested area of Saniyal village, near the international border. #WATCH | Security forces conduct anti-terrorist operation in Jammu & Kashmir's Kathua Terrorists fired indiscriminately on our troops, and heavy fire-fight ensued.

            "description": "UPDATE 2-US investigates Stanford, University of California schools over affirmative action The U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday launched investigations into Stanford University and three University of California schools to ensure they comply with a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down race-conscious admissions.The 2023 ruling effectively prohibited affirmative action policies that were long used to raise the number of Black, Hispanic and other underrepresented minority students on American campuses. U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi directed the department's civil rights division to investigate to ensure that the schools comply with a Supreme Court decision that prevents colleges and universities from discriminating when choosing students for admission, the department said in a news release.In addition to Stanford, the review will cover the University of California, Berkeley, University of California, Los Angeles, and University of California, Irvine. Since taking office for his second term, President Donald Trump's administration has attempted to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the government and the private sector. He has also taken aim at academic institutions and universities, launching dozens of investigations and threatening to cut off funding to schools that promote DEI.\"President Trump and I are dedicated to ending illegal discrimination and restoring merit-based opportunity across the country,\" Bondi said in the release. \"Every student in America deserves to be judged solely based on their hard work, intellect, and character, not the color of their skin.\" The investigations were \"just the beginning\" of the Justice Department's attempt to eradicate DEI programs, the media release said.Stanford University said in a statement it began taking steps to comply with the Supreme Court decision immediately after it was issued. \"We continue to be committed to fulfilling our obligations under the law. We do not have details about today's announcement, but we look forward to learning more about their concerns and responding to the department's questions,\" Stanford spokesperson Dee Mostofi said in an email.Representatives of the three University of California schools did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

Milton was sentenced to four years in prison in 2023 after a jury found him guilty of lying to investors about the company's technology.\"Today I was issued a full and unconditional pardon by Donald Trump himself. He called me personally to tell me,\" Milton said in an Instagram post. The White House and Nikola did not immediately respond to requests for comment.According to federal prosecutors, Milton misled investors by stating that Nikola had built a pickup from the \"ground up,\" that it had developed its own batteries even though he knew it was buying them, and that it had early success creating a \"Nikola One\" semi-truck that he knew did not work. Milton was convicted in October 2022 on one count of securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud, and acquitted on an additional securities fraud count.The company last month filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and would pursue a sale of its assets.",

            "description": "Mohanlal's sequel 'L2: Empuraan' directed by Prithviraj Sukumaran opened powerfully, earning Rs 22 crore across all languages on its first day. The film collected Rs 19.45 crore in Malayalam, with significant success in Kerala's key cities. It received positive reviews for its high production values and narrative, despite a slower second half. ETimes rated it 3.5 out of 5, noting engaging elements but lacking the novelty and punch of its predecessor 'Lucifer'. The movie, however, retains anticipation with fans eager for more.",

            "description": "UPDATE 2-Trump targets WilmerHale in latest White House action against law firms U.S. President Donald Trump issued a proclamation on Thursday targeting law firm WilmerHale, the fifth time the president has taken aim at a major firm with connections to his legal or political adversaries. The proclamation cited WilmerHale's ties to Robert Mueller, the former U.S. special counsel who investigated Russian contacts with Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.It also accused the firm of donating free legal work to support \"destructive\" causes related to immigration and voting, and said it discriminated based on race. Like three earlier executive orders issued by Trump against other firms, the proclamation suspended security clearances held by lawyers at WilmerHale, restricted their access to government officials and ordered a review meant to terminate federal contracts held by the firm's clients.A WilmerHale spokesperson said Trump's proclamation resembled an earlier executive order that was suspended by a judge. \"We look forward to pursuing all appropriate remedies to this unlawful order,\" the firm said.Mueller retired from the firm in 2021 after a \"long, distinguished career in public service,\" the spokesperson said. Mueller could not immediately be reached for comment. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A federal judge on March 12 temporarily blocked most of a similar executive order Trump issued against Perkins Coie, finding it likely violated the U.S. Constitution. The president agreed to drop his executive order against Wall Street law firm Paul Weiss after it agreed last week to donate the equivalent of $40 million in free legal work to administration causes, and to commit to nonpartisanship and merit-based hiring.An earlier, narrower order by Trump suspended security clearances for some lawyers at law firm Covington & Burling. Trump last week directed the Justice Department to recommend similar moves against lawyers and law firms that handle immigration cases or that sued the government over the past eight years - a group that includes many of the largest U.S. firms.WilmerHale, Covington, Perkins Coie and Jenner & Block, another firm targeted in an executive order earlier this week, are each representing clients in lawsuits against the Trump administration over issues such as immigration, transgender rights and firings of government workers. In WilmerHale's case, the firm represents agroup of inspectors general who allege the Trump administration illegally ousted them. The firm also played a key role in lawsuits against the prior Trump administration.Trump's moves against law firms have drawn growing condemnation from lawyers and legal experts. A group of 20 Democratic state attorneys general and the American Bar Association each warned on Wednesday that Trump's efforts posed dangers to the U.S. legal system by chilling lawyers' freedom to choose their clients. WilmerHale, which has a large D.C. office just blocks from the White House, employs more than 1,100 lawyers and has a leading U.S. Supreme Court practice. Some of its major clients include Apple, Harvard University, Meta, and Tesla.The Justice Department appointed Mueller early in Trump's first term to probe Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Moscow. In 2019, Mueller published a report that identified links between the Russian government and Trump's campaign. But Mueller, a former Republican-appointed FBI director, found there was not enough evidence to establish that Trump's campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Moscow.",

            "description": "Brazilian prosecutor tosses Bolsonaro's Covid-19 vaccine status case Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro scored a legal win on Thursday after the country's prosecutor-general tossed a federal police investigation that accused him of falsifying his Covid-19 vaccination status.The decision of prosecutor-general Paulo Gonet came one day after a panel of Supreme Court justices ruled that Bolsonaro and seven of his allies will stand trial on five counts, including attempting to stage a coup after the far-right leader lost the 2022 election.Gonet argued in his decision sent to the Supreme Court, which will have the final word on the case, that he did not find enough evidence against Bolsonaro in the federal police accusation he received one year ago.Federal police accused Bolsonaro and his aides of tampering with the health ministry's database shortly before he travelled to the United States in December 2022, two months after he lost his reelection bid to Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and shortly before the leftist leader took office for the third time in his career.Bolsonaro needed a certificate of vaccination to enter the US, where he remained for the final days of his term and the first months of Lula's term. The former president has repeatedly said he has never taken a Covid-19 vaccine.Brazil's federal police alleged that Bolsonaro and 16 others had inserted false information into a public health database to make it appear as though the then-president, his 12-year-old daughter and several others in his circle had received the Covid-19 vaccine.The investigation said the false vaccination data had been inserted in the public system by a city hall staffer of the city of Duque de Caxias, outside Rio de Janeiro.Bolsonaro has always denied any wrongdoing in the case.Federal police said in its accusation that Bolsonaro's aide-de-camp, Mauro Cid, told investigators in a plea bargain testimony that the former president had asked him to insert the false data into the system for both himself and his daughter. Cid also said he delivered the vaccination certificates to Bolsonaro personally.Gonet argued that other sources and documents did not validate that accusation.During the pandemic, Bolsonaro was among the few world leaders who railed against the vaccine, openly flouting health restrictions and urging other Brazilians to follow suit.",

            "description": "UPDATE 3-Australia PM Albanese calls national election for May 3 Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Friday called a national election for May 3, launching a five-week campaign that is set to be dominated by cost-of-living pressures. Albanese's Labor party won a majority at the last federal election in 2022, but most recent opinion polls show the party neck-and-neck with the opposition Liberal-National coalition when votes from smaller parties are redistributed.\"Our government has chosen to face global challenges the Australian way - helping people under cost-of-living pressure, while building for the future,\" he told a press conference. \"Because of the strength and resilience that our people have shown, Australia is turning the corner. Now on 3 May, you choose the way forward.\" Albanese earlier in the morning met the country's Governor-General Sam Mostyn to seek permission to call a nationwide federal election.Under Australia's constitution the prime minister must formally seek permission to call an election from the governor-general, who represents the head of state, Britain's King Charles. Three-year term limits mean Australia must go to the polls by May 17 at the latest to elect a new parliament.TIGHT CAMPAIGN Albanese has announced a slew of measures aimed at pleasing families and businesses in recent months, including tax cuts in Tuesday's budget, with the rising cost of living in the country set to dominate the campaign.On Friday, Albanese focused his campaign attack on the opposition Liberal and National coalition, saying it would axe government programmes and revoke the new tax cuts passed by parliament this week. A close-run election could mean no single party or coalition of parties will be able to form a government on its own, instead relying on smaller parties to command a majority in the country's lower house.Albanese, a long-time Labor lawmaker who grew up in government housing, came to power on a wave of personal popularity, but has suffered from the rising cost of living and a steep rise in interest rates during his tenure. Falling inflation and the decision by Australia's central bank to cut interest rates for the first time in five years at its February meeting have done little to help Albanese's polling numbers.After enjoying a healthy lead for much of his term, his personal approval ratings are now close to those of Liberal leader Peter Dutton, a former police officer and the defence minister in the last Liberal-National government. Dutton has campaigned on a housing crisis that he says is putting home ownership out of reach, and in a speech on Thursday evening he linked the issue to high immigration. He plans to adopt nuclear power in the country, in opposition to Labor's transition to renewable energy, which Dutton says has increased electricity prices for households and small business.Both leaders have promised an extra A$8.5 billion ($5.42 billion) over four years to shore up the country's public healthcare system. Recounting how his invalid pensioner mother was treated in the same public hospital as an Australian billionaire, Albanese on Friday revised a scare campaign that dominated the 2016 election, suggesting the Liberal and National coalition would cut the national healthcare scheme Medicare. Dutton has said he will match Labor's plan to boost Medicare funding for doctors' visits.Another issue in the campaign will be which leader would best handle relations with U.S. President Donald Trump, who imposed steel and aluminium tariffs that affect Australian exports. Trump is expected to announce a further round of tariffs on trade partners next week. Albanese said his government had been \"engaging on a daily basis\" with the Trump administration over tariffs, and pointed to his two phone calls with the U.S. president and early meetings between the two countries' defence and foreign ministers.Without naming Trump, Albanese sought to cast Dutton as adopting Trump-like policies, such as cutting public servant jobs. \"There are a range of ideas borrowed from others - we need the Australian way,\" Albanese said in his press conference.

            "description": "Australia Faces Tight Election Battle Amid Economic Woes Australia is heading into a closely-watched general election on May 3, as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese declared on Friday. The election comes amid mounting cost of living pressures that have become a pivotal issue for voters.Polls suggest a fiercely contested race between the ruling center-left Labor party and the conservative Liberal-National coalition, spearheaded by Peter Dutton. The outcome could be influenced by a coalition of independent members and smaller parties, potentially tipping the scales if no major party secures a clear majority.Australia's unique electoral framework features compulsory voting. With a three-year maximum term for the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister is responsible for calling the election. This cycle will see 150 seats contested in the lower house, with boundary changes in certain states. The Senate will also see half of its 76 seats in contention.",

Her arrest at the airport, alongside other key figures, has deepened strains with Russia, causing international reverberations.The situation escalated when Russia condemned Moldova's actions, labeling them political persecution against opponents of President Maia Sandu, a pro-European advocate. Russia’s concerns were echoed in a United Nations Security Council meeting where Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy criticized Moldova’s actions.As tensions rise, Moldova maintains that legal proceedings are devoid of political motivation, focusing on criminal justice. The focus on Gutul and others connects to a broader crackdown involving Ilan Shor, a figure linked to a massive banking scandal. The unfolding events highlight Moldova's fragile geopolitical landscape.",

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio revealed at a press conference in Guyana that the State Department may have revoked over 300 visas, including that of Turkish student Rumeysa Ozturk from Tufts University. Held in Somerville, Massachusetts, her detention has sparked a debate over visa policies and free speech.Rubio confirmed the revocation of Ozturk's visa after she voiced support for Palestinians amid the war in Gaza. Despite being a Fulbright Scholar, her detention and subsequent move to Louisiana have drawn widespread criticism, particularly as she hasn't been charged with a crime.Critics claim Ozturk's case, and the broader detentions by the Trump administration, reflect an assault on free speech. The government claims such protests may undermine U.S. foreign policy, sparking a contentious debate on the balance between security and civil liberties.",
