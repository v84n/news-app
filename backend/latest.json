            "description": "US President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued an executive order to prevent transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports unless they were assigned female at birth, The New York Times reported. He also vowed to withhold federal funding from high schools and colleges that fail to comply with the directive. \"From now on, women's sports will be only for women,\" Trump said in his address from the White House East Room. \"The war on women's sports is over.\" President Trump signs executive order banning Transgender women from competing in women’s sports 👀 pic.twitter.com/VKk3u82qBj — FearBuck (@FearedBuck) February 5, 2025 The White House in an executive order titled 'Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,' stated that in recent years, many educational institutions and athletic associations have allowed men to compete in women's sports. It further said that \"ignoring fundamental biological truths\" between the two sexes deprives women and girls of \"meaningful access to educational facilities.\" \"This is demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls, and denies women and girls the equal opportunity to participate and excel in competitive sports. Moreover, under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 (Title IX), educational institutions receiving Federal funds cannot deny women an equal opportunity to participate in sports. As some Federal courts have recognised, ignoring fundamental biological truths between the two sexes deprives women and girls of meaningful access to educational facilities,\" the statement read. It added, \"Therefore, it is the policy of the United States to rescind all funds from educational programmes that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities, which results in the endangerment, humiliation, and silencing of women and girls and deprives them of privacy. It shall also be the policy of the United States to oppose male competitive participation in women's sports more broadly, as a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth.\" This new order follows on one Trump signed on January 20, which ordered the federal government to define sex as only male or female and to change federal policies and government-issued IDs to reflect that. Trump, along with other conservative politicians, have often hit on transgender athletes competing in women's sports as an election-cycle issue. And 25 states have passed laws banning transgender athletes from girls' sports at the high school and youth levels, The New York Times reported. A few days back, the White House had issued an executive order prohibiting federal funding, support, or promotion of medical procedures intended to transition a child's sex, citing concerns over their long-term consequences. The order stated that medical professionals are engaging in \"chemical and surgical mutilation\" of children under the \"radical and false claim that adults can change a child's sex through a series of irreversible medical interventions.\" The administration described these procedures as dangerous, and asserted that affected children may suffer from permanent sterilisation and lifelong medical complications, the report added.",

            "description": "Bhubaneswar: The Odisha government has announced an ex-gratia of Rs 4 lakh each to the family members of the two minor students who drowned in the Kuakhai River here on Wednesday, officials said. Odisha Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi on Wednesday expressed grief over the death of the students in Kuakhai. \"CM Mohan Charan Majhi has expressed deep sorrow over the tragic drowning of two students during Saraswati idol immersion in Kuakhai River, near Rangabazar, under Balianta block. He extended condolences to the bereaved families. The state government has announced Rs 4 lakh ex-gratia assistance for each family from the State Disaster Response Fund,\" said the Chief Minister's Office on X. The deceased were identified as Dibyajyoti Mahalik and Sikun Senapati from Unit-6 area under police limits in Bhubaneswar. Both the students were 15 years old and studied in class 10. Sources claimed that the deceased minors along with their teacher and other friends had gone to the Rangabazar area for the immersion of the Saraswati idol. The two students went into the river water carrying the Goddess idol while the others were at the river bank. Dibyajyoti and Sikun, who entered the river to immerse the idol, lost control and fell into the deep waters. The students failed to come out of the water despite all their efforts. Finding no option, the tuition teacher called up the police and the Fire Service personnel for help. The minors were later fished out of the river by fire services personnel who rushed them to Capital Hospital where the doctors declared the duo dead. The Balianta Police have launched an investigation into the incident by registering an unnatural death case.(IANS)",

मैं बांग्लादेश के लोगों से इंसाफ चाहती हूं। क्या मैंने अपने देश के लिए कुछ नहीं किया? फिर इतना अपमान क्यों? एक इमारत को मिटाया जा सकता है, लेकिन इतिहास को नहीं मिटाया जा सकता। मेरे पिता का घर तोड़ने वालों को याद रखना चाहिए कि इतिहास अपना बदला लेता है। शेख मुजीब के आवास और संग्रहालय में भी घुसे उपद्रवीबांग्लादेश में हाल ही में हिंसा की शुरुआत सोशल मीडिया पर ‘बुलडोजर जुलूस’ के ऐलान के बाद हुई। जब हमला हुआ, तब वहां सुरक्षाबल भी मौजूद थे। भीड़ को वहां से जाने के लिए समझाने की कोशिश की, लेकिन सारी कोशिशें नाकाम रहीं। कुछ उपद्रवी शेख मुजीब के आवास और संग्रहालय में भी घुस गए। बालकनी पर चढ़ गए और तोड़फोड़ की। बताया जा रहा है कि आवास में आगजनी भी की गई है। इसके कई वीडियो और तस्वीरें सोशल मीडिया पर वायरल हो रहे हैं। कल हिंसा क्यों भड़की?दरअसल, शेख हसीना की पार्टी अवामी लीग ने 6 फरवरी को अपने कार्यकर्ताओं और नेताओं को सड़क पर उतरने की अपील की थी। पार्टी पूर्व PM हसीना पर लगे कथित मामले दर्ज करने और अल्पसंख्यकों पर हमले के विरोध में मार्च निकालने का आह्वान किया था। कल शेख हसीना के बांग्लादेश छोड़ने के 6 महीने पूरे हो गए हैं। रात 9 बजे शेख हसीना अपने समर्थकों के लिए ऑनलाइन भाषण देने वाली थीं। इससे पहले '24 रिवोल्यूशनरी स्टूडेंट-जनता' नाम के छात्र संगठन ने इसके विरोध में रात 9 बजे ‘बुलडोजर मार्च’ निकालने का ऐलान किया। इसके लिए सोशल मीडिया पर प्रचार किया गया। इसमें शेख हसीना के पिता का घर गिराए जाने की बात कही गई, लेकिन प्रदर्शनकारी 8 बजे ही शेख मुजीबुर्ररहमान के घर धनमंडी-32 पहुंच गए और तोड़फोड़ शुरू कर दी। हिंसा और तोड़फोड़ की 10 फुटेज... प्रदर्शनकारी 'शेख हसीना को फांसी दो' के नारे लगा रहे थे प्रदर्शनकारी शेख मुजीबुर्ररहमान के घर का मेनगेट तोड़कर अंदर घुस गए। इस दौरान वे 'फांसी दो, फांसी दो। शेख हसीना को फांसी दो।' पूरे बंगाल (बांग्लादेश) को खबर दो, मुजीबुर्रहमान की कब्र खोद दो' 'अवामी लीग के लोगों को पीटो, बांग्लादेश में वे नहीं रहेंगे' के नारे लगा रहे थे। प्रदर्शनकारियों का कहना था कि मुजीबुर्रहमान का घर ‘फासीवादियों का गढ़’ है, इससे छुटकारा पाना जरूरी है।' इसी घर में हुई थी बंगबंधु की हत्या बांग्लादेश के संस्थापक शेख मुजीबुर्रहमान इसी घर में रहा करते थे। 15 अगस्त 1975 को बंगबंधु, उनकी पत्नी, बेटे, बहू और कई रिश्तेदारों की इसी घर में हत्या कर दी गई थी। इसके बाद इस घर को एक स्मारक संग्रहालय के रूप में बनाया गया था। इससे पहले 5 अगस्त 2024 को शेख हसीना के देश छोड़ने के बाद भीड़ ने इस घर पर हमला किया था। तोड़फोड़ कर आग लगा दी गई थी। तब से यह घर वीरान था। आरक्षण के खिलाफ आंदोलन ने किया था तख्तापलटशेख हसीना पिछले साल 5 अगस्त को देश छोड़कर भारत आ गई थीं। दरअसल, उनके खिलाफ देशभर में छात्र प्रदर्शन कर रहे थे। बांग्लादेश में 5 जून को हाईकोर्ट ने जॉब में 30% कोटा सिस्टम लागू किया था, इस आरक्षण के खिलाफ ढाका में यूनिवर्सिटीज के स्टूडेंट्स प्रोटेस्ट कर रहे थे। यह आरक्षण स्वतंत्रता सेनानियों के परिवारों को दिया जा रहा था। हसीना की सरकार ने जैसे ही यह आरक्षण खत्म किया तो इसके बाद छात्रों ने उनके इस्तीफे की मांग शुरू कर दी। देखते ही देखते बड़ी संख्या में छात्र और आम लोग हसीना और उनकी सरकार के खिलाफ सड़क पर उतर आए। इस प्रोटेस्ट के दो महीने बाद 5 अगस्त को उन्होंने प्रधानमंत्री पद से इस्तीफा दे दिया था। इसके बाद अंतरिम सरकार की स्थापना की गई। हसीना का पासपोर्ट रद्द, गिरफ्तारी वारंट जारीबांग्लादेश में तख्तापलट के बाद बनी यूनुस सरकार ने हसीना पर हत्या, अपहरण से लेकर देशद्रोह के 225 से ज्यादा मामले दर्ज किए हैं। वहीं, बांग्लादेशी सरकार ने चेतावनी दी है कि भारत में रहते हुए हसीना की तरफ से दिए जा रहे बयान दोनों देशों के संबंध बिगाड़ रहे हैं।​​​​ बांग्लादेश सरकार ने जुलाई में हुई हत्याओं की वजह से शेख हसीना का पासपोर्ट भी रद्द कर दिया है। वहीं बांग्लादेश के इंटरनेशनल क्रिमिनल ट्रिब्यूनल ने उनके खिलाफ गिरफ्तारी वारंट जारी किया था। ट्रिब्यूनल ने हसीना को 12 फरवरी तक पेश होने का निर्देश दिया है। बांग्लादेश भारत से हसीना को डिपोर्ट करने की अपील भी कर चुका है। हालांकि, भारत सरकार उनका वीजा बढ़ा चुकी है, जिससे यह साफ हो गया कि उन्हें बांग्लादेश डिपोर्ट नहीं किया जाएगा। .................................................. शेख हसीना से जुड़ी ये खबरें भी पढ़ें... हसीना बोलीं- मौत मुझसे सिर्फ 20-25 मिनट दूर थी:विरोधियों ने मुझे मारने की साजिश रची, लेकिन अल्लाह ने मुझे बचाया बांग्लादेश की पूर्व प्रधानमंत्री शेख हसीना ने अपने राजनीतिक विरोधियों पर उन्हें मारने की साजिश का आरोप लगाया। हसीना की पार्टी अवामी लीग ने उनका ऑडियो क्लिप जारी किया है। इसमें हसीना ने बताया कि कैसे वे और उनकी बहन पिछले साल अगस्त में जान बचाकर देश से भागीं थी। पूरी खबर यहां पढ़ें... बांग्लादेश में 6 फरवरी से विरोध प्रदर्शन करेगी अवामी लीग:हसीना पर दर्ज आपराधिक मामलों को हटाने की मांग की बांग्लादेश में पूर्व प्रधानमंत्री शेख हसीना की पार्टी अवामी लीग ने देश भर में विरोध प्रदर्शन, हड़ताल और नाकेबंदी का ऐलान किया है। अवामी लीग ने शेख हसीना के खिलाफ दर्ज मुकदमों और देश में धार्मिक अल्पसंख्यकों पर हो रहे उत्पीड़न के विरोध में ये घोषणा की है। पूरी खबर यहां पढ़ें...",

            "description": "कुंभ नगरी में 13 अखाड़ों के शिविर सेक्टर 12 में हैं। किन्नर अखाड़े का कैंप यहां से बहुत दूर सेक्टर 16 में हैं। यहां मुझे एक किन्नर महंत अपने साथी से फर्राटेदार अंग्रेजी में बात करती दिखीं। पूछने पर किसी ने बताया ये जयंती हैं। चमचमाती बनारसी साड़ी, गले पर तर-ऊपर लदे गहने। माथे पर रोली की बड़ी सी लाल बिंदी। सांवला रंग उस पर मेकअप एकदम टिपटॉप। मैंने जयंती से पूछ लिया कि आप किन्नर महंत कैसे बनीं? कहती हैं कि लोग हमारे साथ नॉर्मल बिहेव नहीं करते। उन्हें हमारे टैलेंट में कोई इंटरेस्ट नहीं। हम सोसाइटी को क्या दे सकते हैं, ये कोई नहीं देखता। बस ये सोचते हैं कि किन्नर सिर्फ दो काम कर सकता है या तो ताली बजाकर भीख मांगेगा या देह बेचेगा। चेहरे पर गुस्से के भाव के साथ इंग्लिश में वो कहती हैं... ‘डोन्ट ट्राई टू चेक आवर बेडरूम स्टोरीज, ट्राई टू सी हाउ प्रोडक्टिव वी केन बी फॉर द सोसाइटी।’ ब्लैकबोर्ड में आज पढ़े-लिखे और जॉब करने वाले ऐसे किन्नरों की कहानी जिन्होंने सामाजिक बैरियर तो तोड़ा, फिर भी समाज उन्हें अपना नहीं पाया... जयंती कहती हैं, कोविड का दौर कोई भूल नहीं सकता, लेकिन मेरे लिए तो ये और भी डरावना था। अक्टूबर 2020 की बात है, लॉकडाउन का दौर था और शारदीय नवरात्र भी चल रहे थे। खाने-पीने का जरूरी सामान लेने घर से निकली थी। रास्ते में चार लोगों ने मुझे किडनैप कर लिया। चारो नशे में थे और उनमें से तीन ने मेरा रेप किया। उनके साथ जो चौथा आदमी था वो बार-बार कह रहा था कि मुझे तो लड़की चाहिए। उन्होंने चाकू मार कर रेप किया और मरने के लिए छोड़ दिया। जयंती कहती हैं किसी भले व्यक्ति ने मुझे हॉस्पिटल पहुंचा दिया। मैं बच गई, लेकिन तभी सर्जरी भी करवा ली और लड़की बन गई। करियर सेट होने के बाद पर्सनल लाइफ भी सेटल हो गई। सक्षम थी तो ये सब कर पाई। हर किन्नर को सक्षम बनना चाहिए। हम जैसे स्पेशल चाइल्ड को घर से बाहर न फेंके, वो सोसाइटी में अनसेफ हैं। जयंती ठाकुर किन्नर अखाड़े की महंत हैं। महामंडलेश्वर डॉ. लक्ष्मी नारायण त्रिपाठी उनकी गुरु हैं। जयंती हैं तो साउथ इंडियन, लेकिन दिल्ली में रहती हैं। यहीं एक मल्टीनेशनल कंपनी में मैनेजर हैं। जयंती कहती हैं किन्नर बच्चा हो, जवान हो या फिर बूढ़ा। उसके जन्म लेते ही परेशानियां शुरू हो जाती हैं। पहले परिवार और फिर समाज। मैं भी इन सब से आज तक जूझ रही हूं। स्कूल-कॉलेज में लोग गुड़, मीठा, मामू, मीठा-चावल, छक्का कहकर बुलाते थे। अच्छी बात ये थी कि मेरे मां-बाप साथ थे। उन्होंने मुझे संभालकर रखा और जहां तक उनसे बन पाया पढ़ाया। पढ़ाई पूरी होने के बाद जॉब लग गई। शुरुआत में घर में ही रही, लेकिन सामाजिक प्रेशर इतना ज्यादा था कि मां-बाप ने मुझे बेहतर जिंदगी के लिए घर से दूर जाकर नौकरी करने की सलाह दी। दिल्ली आ गई। यहां धक्के खाने के बाद एक ऐसी कंपनी में नौकरी मिली जहां एलजीबीटी को सम्मान दिया जाता है। 13 साल से इस कंपनी में जॉब कर रही हूं। वैसे अब मैनेजर हूं तो कम से कम लोग मेरे मुंह पर तो कुछ उल्टा-पुल्टा नहीं कहते, लेकिन पीठ पीछे बातें करते हैं। लोगों को लगता हैं कि ये पोस्ट मैं डिजर्व नहीं करती। मेरी तरक्की से जलते हैं। शुरुआत में मुझे भी दिक्कत हुई, लेकिन कंपनी पॉलिसी के कारण लोग खुल कर कुछ कह नहीं पाते। लोग हैरान रह जाते हैं कि आखिर कैसे इसे इतनी अच्छी नौकरी मिल गई। ऑफिस के बाहर की दुनिया तो कुछ समझती ही नहीं, उनके लिए हिजड़ा ही हूं। हमें अश्लील नजरों से देखते हैं। 9 साल की थी तब सबसे पहले मामा ने, फिर जिस दुकान में काम करती थी वहां भी शारीरिक शोषण हुआ। डरती थी, कभी मां-बाप को अपनी परेशानी नहीं बता पाई। मेरे पापा सिक्योरिटी गार्ड थे। हम स्कूल तो जाते थे, लेकिन यूनिफॉर्म, जूते के लिए तरसते थे। 10वीं के बाद आगे की पढ़ाई के पैसे नहीं थे। इसलिए एक कपड़े की दुकान में साफ सफाई का काम करने लगी। यहां से 600 रुपए मिल जाते थे। मुझे लगा कि ऐसे तो जिंदगी नहीं चल पाएगी। आगे बढ़ने के लिए और समाज से लड़ने के लिए और पढ़ना पड़ेगा। साफ सफाई का काम छोड़कर 3 साल के गैप के बाद फिर से पढ़ाई शुरू की। बच्चों को ट्यूशन भी पढ़ाने लगी। ग्रेजुएशन के साथ-साथ एक स्कूल में इंग्लिश भी पढ़ा रही थी। साल 2008 में कॉल सेंटर का बूम आया। मैंने भी इंटरव्यू देना शुरू कर दिया, लेकिन नौकरी नहीं मिली। फिर मैंने पढ़ाई पूरी की और दो-तीन नौकरियां भी बदलीं। आज यूके की सबसे बड़ी बैंकिंग कंपनी में मैनेजर के रोल पर काम कर रही हूं। जयंती कहती हैं कि अब समय बदल रहा है इसलिए समाज को भी सोच बदलने की जरूरत है। बेटा- बेटी ही नहीं, एक किन्नर भी घर चला सकता है। एक किन्नर भी किसी के घर की बहू बन सकती है, अपने मां बाप को पाल सकती है। किन्नरों को भी एक मौका दीजिए, क्या पता कल आपका स्पेशल चाइल्ड लक्ष्मी नारायण त्रिपाठी, गौरी सावंत, सुशांत दिग्वीकर या फिर जयंती ठाकुर जैसा बन जाए। इतना कहते-कहते जयंती की आंखों से भरभराकर आंसू गालों तक बह निकले... पल भर चुप रहने के बाद वे ऊपर देखते हुए कहती हैं, जब लॉकडाउन में चार लोगों ने मेरा रेप किया तो समझ आया कि जो वहशी होते हैं, उन्हें बस हवस बुझानी होती है फिर चाहे कोई किन्नर हो, बच्चा हो या कोई लड़की हो। हम भी दूसरे बच्चों की तरह एक मां की कोख से 9 महीने बाद ही जन्म लेते हैं। किन्नर अखाड़े में मां पवित्रा नंद गिरी से आशीर्वाद लेने लोग लाइन लगाए खड़े हैं। सबसे फ्री होकर मुझसे मिली। कहती हैं कि किन्नरों के साथ हमेशा भेदभाव होता है। काम नहीं मिलता, रहने के लिए कोई घर नहीं देता। हमें देखकर लोग किराया बढ़ा देते हैं। हम जैसे अधिकतर लोग झुग्गियों में रहते हैं। हमारे लिए पढ़ाई-लिखाई बहुत जरूरी है। पढ़ेंगे तो नौकरी मिलेगी। कम से कम अपना शरीर नहीं बेचना पड़ेगा। ऐसा नहीं है कि नौकरी मिलने के बाद परेशानियां कम हो जाती हैं। ऑफिस में हमारे साथ क्या व्यवहार होता है ये सिर्फ हम जानते हैं। बिना किसी से नजर मिलाए अपना काम करना होता है। किसी से नजर मिल ही गई, तो वो न जाने क्या समझ लेता है। मैंने बीएससी नर्सिंग करके 15 साल नौकरी की। जब लोगों को पता चला कि किन्नर हूं तो उनका नजरिया ही बदल गया। हम बस हंसी-ठिठोली का पात्र बनकर रह जाते हैं। मेरी एजुकेशन, मेरा एक्सपीरियंस कुछ भी मायने नहीं रखता, बस हमें ताली बजाने वाला छक्का समझा जाता है। हमें सिग्नल पर खड़े होकर भीख नहीं मांगना या जिस्म बेचकर पैसे नहीं कमाने इसलिए अपमान सहकर भी हम नौकरी करते हैं। मैं जब जॉब करती थी तो भी लोग मुझे चिढ़ाते थे। कहते थे ये तो छक्का है, क्या काम करेगा, इन्हें तो गलियों में जाना चाहिए, यहां क्या कर रही हैं। मुझे काम करता देख कलीग जलते थे। उन्हें हजम नहीं होता कि उनसे बेहतर कैसे कर रहे हैं। हमें तो प्रमोशन भी नहीं मिलता। मैं मानती हूं कि मेहनत करके ही पैसा कमाना चाहिए क्योंकि मेहनत का पैसा जिंदगी भर फल देता है। हम लोगों से अपील करते हैं कि एजुकेशन लें और समाज भी उन्हें अपनाए। हमारे अखाड़े का निर्माण भी इसलिए ही हुआ है ताकि किन्नरों को सही रास्ता दिखाया जा सके। अगर मैं कंधे से कंधा मिलाकर समाज के लिए काम कर रही हूं तो समाज भी हमें सम्मान और बराबरी का मौका देता है। अगर 10 में से 2 लोग हमें अच्छा समझते हैं तो इसके पीछे सबसे बड़ा कारण एजुकेशन है। महामंडलेश्वर इंदुनंद गिरी तंबू के अंदर हाथ में एक त्रिशूल लेकर बैठी हैं। माथे पर चंदन का टीका, बड़ी सी बिंदी, गले में रुद्राक्ष की माला, सोने की चेन, हाथ में चूड़ियां और कंगन पहने ध्यान की मुद्रा में हैं। ध्यान से उठने के बाद हमारे बीच बातचीत शुरू होती है। महाकुंभ की तारीफ और महादेव का नाम लेने के साथ वो बात की शुरुआत करती हैं। वो कहती हैं कि बचपन से मुझे मां काली की भक्ति बहुत पसंद है। मुझे मां का हर रूप पसंद है, लेकिन काली रूप सबसे ज्यादा। बचपन की यादें सांझा करते हुए वे कहती हैं कि लोगों की बातें और कटाक्ष असहनीय होते थे। खुल के बात भी नहीं कर पाती थी। मेकअप, डांस करना और पेंटिंग करना पसंद था, लेकिन सब छुपकर करती थी। स्कूल जाती थी तो लोग अजीब नजरों से देखते थे। घर से निकलने में भी डर लगता था। लगता था कि सबसे अलग हूं और मेरे जैसा कोई नहीं है। बड़े होने पर किन्नर कम्युनिटी का पता चला। वहां से मुझे सपोर्ट मिला, जिसकी वजह से यहां तक पहुंची। मेकअप आर्टिस्ट थी तो काम मिलने में दिक्कत नहीं हुई। जब लोगों को पता चला कि किन्नर हूं, तो परेशानी शुरू हो गई। सब कहने लगे, माहौल खराब हो जाएगा। किन्नर लोग चोर होते हैंं, गलत काम करते हैं, इनके कारण कोई भी ग्राहक नहीं आएगा। इसलिए मुझे वहां से निकाल दिया गया। मेकअप करना, किसी को सजाना-संवारना मेरे लिए जुनून जैसा था। सारे अपमान को भूल कर मैंने काम किया। धीरे-धीरे लोग मुझे पसंद करने लगे। समाज हमारे जेंडर को टारगेट करता है, हमारे हुनर पर नजर नहीं डालता। हम भी इज्जत से कमाना, रहना और खाना चाहते हैं। किन्नर अखाड़े में मेरी मुलाकात ईशा बेंजमिन से हुई। वो एक फोल्डिंग पर बैठी हैं। उनके पीछे मां दुर्गा की प्रतिमा रखी है और आसपास से भक्तों का आना-जाना लगा है। ईशा बताती हैं कि उनका जन्म मुंबई में हुआ, लेकिन अब दिल्ली में रहती हैं। पापा यहूदी थे और मां सनातनी। ईशा कहती हैं, मैं आचार्य महामंडलेश्वर लक्ष्मी नारायण त्रिपाठी की शिष्य हूं। जन्म से तो हम खुद को दुनिया का हिस्सा समझते हैं, लेकिन जब बड़े होते हैं तो ये बता दिया जाता है कि हम अलग हैं। लोगों के देखने का नजरिया, बात करने का तरीका, उनकी सोच ये बताती है कि हम अलग या हटकर हैं। ग्रेजुएट हूं, होटल मैनेजमेंट की डिग्री भी है। यहूदी और सनातन दोनों धर्म समझती थी और दोनों में मेरी आस्था थी। धीरे-धीरे मुझे सनातन अच्छा लगने लगा। गुरु जी ने मुझे सनातन के बारे में बताया और हर दिन कुछ नया सीख रही हूं। यूएस बेस्ड कंपनी में जॉब करती हूं और मेरा वर्क फ्रॉम होम है। हमारी कंपनी एलजीबीटी कम्युनिटी को बहुत सपोर्ट करती है। इसके बावजूद हम लोगों को नहीं बदल सकते। जैसे लोग चावल से कंकड़ चुनकर फेंक देते हैं, ठीक वैसे ही मैं लोगों की बातें नजरअंदाज करती हूं। मुझे ट्रैवल में ज्यादा दिक्कत होती थी। कोई गलत तरीके से छूने का बहाना खोजता था, तो कोई मजाक बनाता था। लोग वॉशरूम के बाहर खड़े होकर देखते कि औरतों वाले में जाएगी या मर्दों वाले में। हायर एजुकेशन के दौरान मुझे बहुत शोषण झेलना पड़ा था। लोग गंदे-गंदे कमेंट करते, लेटर लिख कर देते और घर तक फॉलो करते थे। मैं एजुकेटेड हूं तो लोग मुझे अलग नजरिए से देखते हैं, सम्मान देते हैं। मैं इंटरनेट पर एजुकेटेड किन्नर के नाम से वायरल हूं। आज से 10 साल पहले हम जैसे लोगों के लिए एजुकेशन की दिक्कत थी, लेकिन अब समय बदल चुका है। मैं लोगों से अपील करना चाहती हूं कि बच्चा, किन्नर हो तो उसे घर से मत निकालो। कई बच्चे शर्म के मारे खुद ही घर छोड़ के चले जाते हैं। इसको बदलने की जरूरत है और ये सिर्फ एजुकेशन से ही होगा। एजुकेशन के कारण मुझे ना तो भीख मांगनी पड़ती है और ना ही देह बेचनी पड़ती है। मुझसे मिलने और आशीर्वाद लेने लोग दूर-दूर से आते हैं।

            "description": "5 फरवरी की दोपहर करीब 2 बजे। अमृतसर के श्री गुरु रामदासजी इंटरनेशनल एयरपोर्ट पर अमेरिका का C-17 ग्लोबमास्टर प्लेन लैंड किया। इसमें से 104 अवैध भारतीय अप्रवासी उतरे, जिन्हें ट्रम्प सरकार ने कैदियों की तरह जबरन डिपोर्ट किया है। अवैध अप्रवासियों को मिलिट्री प्लेन से भेजना नॉर्मल फ्लाइट से करीब 6 गुना महंगा है, फिर भी इसका इस्तेमाल करके ट्रम्प ने क्या संदेश दिया और क्या ये भारत सरकार का डिप्लोमैटिक फेल्योर है; जानेंगे आज के एक्सप्लेनर में... सवाल-1: अवैध भारतीय अप्रवासियों को किस दशा में अमेरिका से डिपोर्ट किया गया?जवाब: 20 जनवरी 2025 को अमेरिका के राष्ट्रपति पद की शपथ लेने के बाद अवैध अप्रवासियों के मुद्दे पर ट्रम्प ने कहा, 'हम बुरे, खूंखार अपराधियों को बाहर निकाल रहे हैं। ये हत्यारे हैं। ये सबसे बुरे हैं, जितने आप सोच नहीं सकते। हम सबसे पहले उन्हें बाहर निकाल रहे हैं।' ट्रम्प ने ‘लैकेन रिले एक्ट’ पर साइन किया, जिससे अमेरिकी अधिकारियों को उन अवैध अप्रवासियों को हिरासत में लेकर डिपोर्ट करने का अधिकार मिला, जो किसी आपराधिक गतिविधियों में शामिल रहे हैं। इसके बाद 15 लाख अवैध अप्रवासियों की लिस्ट तैयार की गई, जिसमें 20,407 हजार भारतीय भी हैं। 24 जनवरी को व्हाइट हाउस की प्रेस सचिव कैरोलिन लेविट ने सोशल मीडिया प्लेटफॉर्म X पर हथकड़ी लगे प्रवासियों की तस्वीरें पोस्ट की थीं। जो एक-दूसरे से बंधे हुए थे और एक सैन्य विमान की ओर बढ़ रहे थे। 30 जनवरी 2025 को अमेरिका ने 80 अप्रवासियों को टेक्सास से ग्वाटेमाला भेजा था। इन अप्रवासियों की तस्वीरें भी जारी हुई थीं, जिसमें उनके हाथों में हथकड़ी और पैरों में बेड़ियां बंधी हुई थीं। ट्रम्प प्रशासन ने भारत के अवैध अप्रवासियों की पहली खेप भी मिलिट्री विमान से भेजी। उनकी कोई फोटो या वीडियो मौजूद नहीं है, जिससे ये कन्फर्म नहीं कि भारतीयों को हथकड़ी-बेड़ी पहनाई गई थी या नहीं। हालांकि अभी तक सरकार ने इसका खंडन भी नहीं किया गया है। कांग्रेस नेता पवन खेड़ा ने सोशल मीडिया प्लेटफॉर्म X पर एक पोस्ट में कहा, अमेरिका से डिपोर्ट हुए भारतीयों को हथकड़ी लगाए जाने और अपमानित किए जाने की तस्वीरें देखकर मुझे दुख होता है। सवाल-2: आखिर ट्रम्प अमेरिका में मौजूद अवैध अप्रवासियों पर इतने सख्त क्यों हैं?जवाब: डोनाल्ड ट्रम्प ने चुनाव में अवैध अप्रवासियों को देश से निकालने का वादा करते हुए अमेरिका के इतिहास का सबसे बड़ा डिपोर्टेशन करने को कहा था। ट्रम्प का मानना है कि दूसरे देशों से लोग अमेरिका में अवैध तरीके से घुसकर अपराध करते हैं। यहां नौकरियों के बड़े हिस्से पर अप्रवासियों का कब्जा है, इससे अमेरिकी लोगों को नौकरी नहीं मिलती। कांग्रेस नेता शशि थरूर के मुताबिक अमेरिका से अवैध अप्रवासियों को डिपोर्ट करना कोई अनोखी बात नहीं है। बाइडेन प्रशासन ने भी 1 साल में 1100 अप्रवासियों को भारत वापस भेजा था। अमेरिकी होमलैंड सुरक्षा विभाग की एक रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, 1 अक्टूबर 2023 से 30 सितंबर 2024 तक बाइडेन सरकार ने 1,100 भारतीय अप्रवासियों को भारत वापस भेजने के लिए चार्टर्ड प्लेन और कॉमर्शियल फ्लाइट का इस्तेमाल किया था। इनमें सिर्फ पुरुष और महिलाएं थीं। अवैध अप्रवासियों के बच्चे शामिल नहीं थे। सवाल-3: अवैध प्रवासियों को सामान्य फ्लाइट से भेजा जा सकता था, फिर ट्रम्प ने 6 गुना महंगे मिलिट्री प्लेन से कैदियों की तरह क्यों भेजा?जवाब: ट्रम्प ने अक्सर अवैध अप्रवासियों को ‘एलियन’ और ‘अपराधी’ कहा है, जिन्होंने अमेरिका पर हमला किया। सैन्य विमान से अप्रवासियों को भेजने का उद्देश्य इस ओर इशारा करता है कि ट्रम्प ऐसे अपराधों के प्रति सख्त हैं। ट्रम्प ने कहा, हम अवैध विदेशियों का पता लगा रहे हैं और उन्हें सैन्य विमानों में भरकर वापस उन जगहों पर भेजा जा रहा है जहां से वे आए थे। 24 जनवरी को व्हाइट हाउस की प्रेस सचिव कैरोलिन लेविट ने लिखा, ‘राष्ट्रपति ट्रम्प पूरी दुनिया को एक मजबूत और स्पष्ट संदेश दे रहे हैं कि अगर आप अवैध रूप से अमेरिका में प्रवेश करते हैं, तो आपको गंभीर परिणाम भुगतने होंगे।’ फॉरेन एक्सपर्ट ए.के. पाशा के मुताबिक जिस तरह ट्रम्प ने अवैध अप्रवासियों को कैदियों की तरह भारत वापस भेजा, इससे साफ जाहिर हो रहा है कि वे भारत को एक कमजोर देश समझते हैं। अपने आक्रामक रुख से वो भारत को दबाव में लाना चाहते हैं। सवाल-4: क्या भारतीयों के प्रति ट्रम्प का ये रवैया भारत का डिप्लोमैटिक फेल्योर है?जवाब: 21 जनवरी को वॉशिंगटन डीसी में भारत के विदेश मंत्री एस जयशंकर और अमेरिकी विदेश मंत्री मार्को रुबियो की मुलाकात हुई थी। तब मार्को ने अवैध भारतीय प्रवासियों का मुद्दा उठाया था। इस पर विदेश मंत्री जयशंकर ने कहा था कि भारत उन प्रवासियों को वापस लेने को तैयार हैं, जो अधूरे या बगैर दस्तावेज के अमेरिका पहुंचे थे। एस. जयशंकर ने कहा, 'भारत जांच कर रहा है कि अमेरिका में कितने भारतीय अवैध रूप से रह रहे हैं और इन्हें वापस भेजा जा सकता है या नहीं।' ए.के. पाशा के मुताबिक, ‘पहले भी अवैध अप्रवासी डिपोर्ट किए गए हैं, लेकिन उन्हें इस तरह स्वीकार करना सरकार का डिप्लोमैटिक फेल्योर है। विदेश मंत्री को यह सुनिश्चित करना जरूरी था कि अमेरिका अवैध अप्रवासियों को किस तरह भेजेगा। अगर यह पहले तय हो गया होता तो आज भारत के लोगों के हाथों में हथकड़ियां नहीं होतीं और उन्हें सैन्य विमान से बड़े अपराधियों की तरह डिपोर्ट नहीं किया जाता।’ ट्रम्प ने जब कोलंबिया के अवैध प्रवासियों को अमेरिकी सेना के विमान से उनके देश वापस भेजने की घोषणा की तो कोलंबिया के राष्ट्रपति गुस्तावो पेड्रो ने इसका विरोध किया। उन्होंने कहा कि वो अपने नागरिकों की 'गरिमा' को बनाए रखना चाहते हैं। इसके बाद कोलंबिया वायु सेना के दो विमान अमेरिका गए और वो अवैध प्रवासियों को लेकर राजधानी बोगोटा पहुंचे। सवाल-5: अमेरिका के इस रवैये पर भारत सरकार का क्या रुख है?जवाब: विदेश मामलों के जानकार और JNU के प्रोफेसर राजन कुमार कहते हैं, भारत ट्रम्प के इस रवैये पर खामोश है, क्योंकि PM मोदी और ट्रम्प की मुलाकात होने वाली है। भारत अभी कोई बयान देकर नया विवाद खड़ा नहीं करना चाहता। अगर भारत के किसी बयान से ट्रम्प नाराज हो गए तो यह मुलाकात रद्द हो सकती है।’ ए.के. पाशा ने कहा, PM मोदी फिलहाल ट्रम्प प्रशासन के खिलाफ नहीं बोलेंगे, क्योंकि वे ट्रम्प के साथ दोस्ती को मजबूत करना चाहते हैं। दुनिया के सबसे ताकतवर देश अमेरिका से भारत दुश्मनी करने की स्थिति में नहीं है। सवाल-6: क्या पीएम मोदी और ट्रम्प की मुलाकात से यह मामला सुलझेगा?जवाब: BHU में यूनेस्को चेयर फॉर पीस के प्रोफेसर प्रियंकर उपाध्याय का कहना है कि PM मोदी और अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति ट्रम्प की मुलाकात से अप्रवासियों का डिपोर्टेशन नहीं रुकेगा। भारत इस स्थिति में नहीं है कि अप्रवासियों की वापसी पर रोक लगा सके। अमेरिका सुपर पावर है और बीते कुछ दिनों से अमेरिका और भारत के रिश्तों में दरार पड़ने लगी है। ऐसे में PM मोदी अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति के फैसले को चुनौती नहीं देंगे। 28 जनवरी को PM मोदी ने डोनाल्ड ट्रम्प से फोन पर बात की थी। इसके बाद ट्रम्प ने कहा, अवैध अप्रवासियों के मुद्दे पर मोदी वही करेंगे, जो सही होगा। जब हम अमेरिका में अवैध तरीके से रह रहे भारतीयों को उनके देश भेजेंगे, तो मोदी सही फैसला लेंगे। भारत के साथ हमारे बहुत अच्छे संबंध हैं। हम भारत से IT प्रोफेशनल्स को लेने के लिए तैयार हैं। प्रियंकर उपाध्याय कहते हैं कि भारत का अपने पड़ोसी देशों की तुलना में अमेरिका के साथ दोहरा रवैया है। बांग्लादेश के अप्रवासियों को लेकर सरकार का नजरिया सख्त रहा है, लेकिन अमेरिकी अप्रवासियों के लिए मोदी सरकार ने हामी भर दी, क्योंकि यह इकोनॉमिक माइग्रेंट्स हैं। आसान भाषा में समझें तो यह वो लोग हैं जो अमेरिका में पैसा कमाने के लिए गए थे। इसलिए PM मोदी, ट्रम्प से इस विषय में बात नहीं करेंगे। सवाल-7: अभी अमेरिका में कितने अवैध भारतीय अप्रवासी बचे हैं और क्या उन्हें भी डिपोर्ट किया जाएगा?जवाब: मीडिया रिपोर्ट्स के मुताबिक, अमेरिका में अभी 20,407 अवैध भारतीय अप्रवासी ऐसे हैं जिन्हें डिपोर्टेशन का सामना करना पड़ रहा है। इनमें से 17,940 भारतीय लोगों को निकालने के लिए अंतिम आदेश जारी किया जा चुका है। वहीं 2,467 भारतीयों को अमेरिकी इमिग्रेशन विभाग (ICE) ने हिरासत में ले रखा है। प्यू रिसर्च सेंटर की 2022 की रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, अमेरिका में लगभग 7.25 लाख अवैध भारतीय अप्रवासी रहते हैं। यह आंकड़ा अवैध प्रवासियों की तीसरी सबसे बड़ी संख्या है। सवाल-8: इस डिपोर्टेशन में कितना खर्च आया और क्या ये रकम भारत चुका रहा है?जवाब: अप्रवासियों के लौटने का खर्च भारत नहीं, बल्कि ट्रम्प सरकार उठा रही है। ग्लोबमास्टर C-17 के भारत का एक चक्कर लगाने में करीब 6 करोड़ रुपए का खर्च आया है। ये सामान्य चार्टर्ड उड़ान से लगभग छह गुना ज्यादा है। आज 104 लोगों को C-17 सैन्य विमान से भेजने का खर्च 6 करोड़ रुपए रहा। यानी एक व्यक्ति का खर्च 5.76 लाख रुपए है। अमेरिका को 20 हजार अवैध अप्रवासियों को भारत भेजने के लिए 1.2 हजार करोड़ रुपए खर्च करने होंगे। इसके लिए C-17 सैन्य विमान को लगभग 193 चक्कर लगाने होंगे। अमेरिकी रक्षा विभाग डिपार्टमेंट ऑफ डिफेंस (DOD) अप्रवासियों को हटाने की मुहिम में 4 मिलिट्री एयरक्राफ्ट्स का इस्तेमाल कर रही है। इनमें दो C-17 और दो C-130E विमान शामिल हैं। रिसर्च सहयोग- गंधर्व झा -------------- अमेरिका

            "description": "USPS Reverses China Parcel Ban Amid Trade Confusion The U.S. Postal Service announced on Wednesday that it will resume accepting parcels from China and Hong Kong. This comes after a temporary 12-hour suspension following President Donald Trump's decision to end exemptions allowing duty-free entry for low-value packages. Major retailers like Temu, Shein, and Amazon had utilized this exemption.The sudden reversal has contributed to widespread confusion among retailers and express shipping companies. These businesses are now grappling with the implications of Trump's new 10% tariff on Chinese imports, as well as the end of the 'de minimis' duty exemption for packages valued under $800. This regulatory change aims to curb the influx of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the United States.International shipping companies, while committed to ensuring deliveries, acknowledge potential disruptions as USPS coordinates with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to manage tariff collections on small packages. The swift enactment of these changes leaves businesses with little time to adjust, raising concerns about operational and financial impacts.",

            "description": "Karachi: A 33-year-old American woman from New York, Onijah Andrew Robinson, has become an unexpected viral sensation in Pakistan after her dramatic journey to meet her online lover, 18-year-old Nidal Ahmed Memon, in Karachi in October 2024, The Express Tribune reported. Also Read: Nigerian traveller causes chaos at airport over visa issues, throws sanitary pads at airline staff (WATCH) The story has captivated audiences globally, especially after it was revealed that Robinson had been using a filter to portray herself as a white blonde woman during her online conversations with Memon. Despite the deception, the two reportedly wed in an online Nikah, an Islamic marriage ceremony, setting the stage for the drama that was about to unfold. Upon arriving in Pakistan, Robinson faced immediate rejection from Memon's mother, who disapproved of the relationship due to Robinson's age and the fact that she had misled her son. Despite this, Memon appeared to be willing to continue the relationship, perhaps motivated by the prospect of obtaining a US green card. Tensions escalated when Memon and his mother fled their home, leaving Robinson stranded. However, this did little to deter her, and she set up camp outside Memon's apartment complex, quickly drawing the attention of local residents and media, reported The Express Tribune. Her presence outside the apartment sparked a flurry of viral content as she engaged in public outbursts, made demands for money, and became a regular subject of memes. Videos showcasing Robinson's antics, including bizarre McDonald orders and failed attempts to check into a psychiatric facility, further fuelled her notoriety. Despite several offers of assistance from local humanitarian Chippa, Robinson repeatedly rejected help, adding to the spectacle surrounding her. As the drama continued to unfold, Robinson gained attention from local men who began proposing to her, with some hopeful that marriage could provide them with the opportunity to move to the US. In addition, Robinson formed unlikely friendships with local residents and policewomen, who treated her with respect, reflecting Pakistan's cultural emphasis on hospitality, The Express Tribune reported. 🚨 Woman Holds herself hostage in Pakistan 🇵🇰 This situation feels like we're living in a parallel universe, wait, hear me out...

            "description": "महाकुंभ में चल रहे धर्मसंसद में स्वामी अविमुक्तेश्वरानंद ने कहा धर्मशिक्षा हमारे जीवन का अनिवार्य अङ्ग होती थी पर स्वतन्त्रता प्राप्ति के बाद स्वीकृत संविधान की धारा-30 ने देश के अल्पसंख्यकों को तो धार्मिक आधार पर शिक्षण संस्थान बनाने और सञ्चालित करने का अधिकार दिया पर हम बहुसंख्यकों को इस सुविधा से वञ्चित कर दिया और परिणामस्वरूप आज 75 वर्ष से आगे आ जाने पर भी हिन्दुओं के बच्चे धार्मिक शिक्षा से पूरी तरह वञ्चित होकर किङ्कर्तव्यविमूढ़ अथवा मतान्तर के लिए मजबूर हो रहे हैं। धार्मिक शिक्षा प्राप्त करना हर हिंदू बच्चे का अधिकार उन्होंने कहा परमधर्मसंसद् इस परमधर्मादेश के माध्यम से यह घोषित करती है कि धार्मिक शिक्षा प्राप्त करना हर हिन्दू बच्चे का मौलिक अधिकार है। आवयश्कता होने पर संविधान में संशोधन किया जाए और हर हिन्दू बच्चे को उसके धर्म की शिक्षा प्राप्त करने के लिए पर्याप्त व्यवस्था और वातावरण उपलब्ध कराया जाए। धर्म के हर मुद्दे मिले शिक्षा शंकराचार्य ने कहा - मानव जीवन के कई कोण हैं, जिनमे धार्मिकता भी सम्मिलित है। चूँकि हमारा पूरा जीवन धर्मसम्मत बीतता है इसलिए आरम्भिक जीवन में ही हम धर्म के नियम-विनियमों के साथ ही साथ उसके मर्म को भी शिक्षा के माध्यम से समझ लिया करते थे। यह माना जाता था कि धर्मविहीन जीवन पशु जीवन है। धर्मेण हीनः पशुभिः समानः। अध्ययन की समाप्ति के बाद गुरुकुल से घर लौटते समय हमारा गुरु अपने बच्चे को दीक्षान्त समारोह में आदेश देता था - सत्यम् वद। धर्मं चर आदि। जिसका तात्पर्य धर्मानुकूल जीवन बिताने के आदेश से होता। था।",

            "description": "Khordha: Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi today launched 'Viksit Gaon Viksit Odisha', the scheme rebranded by the BJP Government for development of rural Odisha, at Jankia here in the district. The scheme was launched at a programme attended by Panchayatiraj & Rural Debelopment Minister Rabi Narayan Naik, Khordha MLA Prasanta Jagadev, Bhubaneswar-Ekamra MLA Babu Singh and Collector Chanchal Rana. Speaking at the event, CM said, \"We need to keep politics and development separately.\" Attacking the BJD, he said, \"The previous government that ruled 24 years in Odisha had conspired to create vote bank in name of 5T. However, the BJP government will continue fighting against poverty and backwardness. Under the Viksit Gaon Viksit Odisha scheme, each village will be developed within five years.\" Earlier, a detailed guideline has been released for the implementation of Viksit Gaon Viksit Odisha scheme. The collectors have been asked to prepare 5-year action plan for the development of villages and send the report to the government by February 15. Notably, Mohan Majhi-led BJP Government recently replaced Naveen Patnaik-led BJD government’s flagship rural scheme “Ama Odisha Nabina Odisha” with the Viksit Gaon Viksit Odisha (Developed Village, Developed Odisha). Under this scheme, the government will spend around Rs 5,000 crore in the next five years.",

            "description": "Manila: Philippines Vice President Sara Duterte has been impeached by the House of Representatives, with over half of its more than 300 members supporting the impeachment complaint. This move sets the stage for a trial in the Senate, marking a critical juncture in Duterte's tenure. Duterte, the daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte, has been accused of misusing millions of dollars in confidential funds during her tenure as Education Secretary. She's also been accused of threatening President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr, which she denies. The impeachment complaint lists 24 articles, including graft and corruption, bribery, betrayal of public trust, and other high crimes. Duterte claims she's the victim of a political vendetta, fueled by her bitter feud with Marcos. This move is seen as an escalation of their long-standing rivalry, which has kept the nation on edge. The feud began when Duterte resigned as Education Secretary in June 2024, citing differences with Marcos. Since then, tensions have risen, with Duterte publicly criticizing Marcos' leadership.",

            "description": "GTA 6 Release Date: The gaming community is abuzz with speculation following a recent leak suggesting a possible release date for the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6). According to reports, a Spanish retailer named XUruguay listed the game with a launch date of September 17, 2025. The listing, which was spotted by industry publication 80 Level, aligns closely with Rockstar Games’ official announcement of a fall 2025 release window.Possible PlayStation 5 Exclusive?What has fueled further intrigue is the suggestion that the game may initially be exclusive to the PlayStation 5. While this claim has sparked excitement among PlayStation owners, it has left Xbox enthusiasts concerned about being left out. The supposed launch date of September 17 notably falls on the 12th anniversary of the release of GTA 5, making the timing seem deliberate. However, the listing was swiftly removed from XUruguay's site, casting doubt on its accuracy.Reports indicate that a local source reached out to XUruguay for confirmation. The retailer allegedly claimed to have inside information from PlayStation regarding product launches. Despite this assertion, neither Rockstar Games nor its parent company, Take-Two Interactive, has issued any statements about the leaked date.Industry Speculation, Take-Two’s Upcoming Earnings CallTake-Two Interactive has reiterated its plans to release GTA 6 in the fall of 2025. While rumours of delays have circulated, the company has not indicated any changes to its timeline. Industry observers are closely watching the company's earnings call scheduled for February 6, 2025, in the hope of gaining clearer insights.The leak also raises questions about the game’s availability for older consoles. It appears increasingly likely that players without next-generation hardware may miss out on the initial release. Meanwhile, speculation about the game’s pricing continues, with some suggesting it could be priced between $80 and $100. However, many analysts have dismissed these estimates as unlikely.What’s Next For GTA 6 Fans?As Rockstar Games remains tight-lipped, fans are left waiting for official confirmation or denial of the leaked details. Given the franchise’s immense popularity, any update on the game’s development and release timeline will undoubtedly attract widespread attention.Whether the leak holds any truth or is merely a speculative blip, the anticipation for GTA 6 continues to build, making it one of the most eagerly awaited video game launches in recent memory.",

            "description": "Annual ASU+GSV & Emeritus Summit convened today, gathering prominent global leaders, thought leaders, and innovators from across sectors to explore transformative solutions for education and the future of work in a world increasingly shaped by generative AI. Running from February 3-5 at The Oberoi, the summit draws attention to the urgent need for innovation across the entire education spectrum—from \"Pre-K to Gray\"—amid technological advances that are changing how we learn and work.The second day of the Summit featured an impressive lineup of speakers and esteemed guests, including Charge D’Affaires Jorgan K. Andrews from the US Embassy in New Delhi, Michael M. Crow – President, Arizona State University (ASU), former Union Minister Suresh Prabhu, Sanjeev Sanyal – a Member of Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM), Ved Mani Tiwari – CEO, National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), Deborah Quazzo – Managing Partner at GSV Ventures, as well as other leaders and investors from the education and the edtech ecosystem across the world.The event kicked off with a keynote address by Michael M. Crow, President, ASU, emphasizing the criticality of innovation in preparing students for the workforce. He stated, \"We have an unbelievably complicated environment, and yet we are helping 40,000 students, both online and offline, graduate with degrees at par with the best colleges in the United States. The employability of our students is 97%, meaning they find themselves either employed or in grad school within a year of studying at ASU. Our faculty is able to do this incredibly difficult task because of the technologies we are absorbing.\"Former Union Minister and Chancellor at Rishihood University, Suresh Prabhu, delivered a powerful message on the need for a cultural shift to promote innovation in India. He emphasized that although change can happen overnight, inaction is not the answer. \"It starts with a cultural shift—respect for researchers drives innovation. The government can support R&D with tax breaks, but corporate commitment is key. Just as ESG compliance influences investment, why not R&D compliance? A strong research pipeline is essential, as breakthroughs take time and resources. If investors reward innovation, businesses will prioritize it. Real progress needs collaboration between government, corporates, and investors to make R&D a fundamental driver of growth,” he added.Rahul Bothra, CFO of Swiggy and Ashwin Damera, Co-Founder & CEO, Emeritus, engaged in a thought-provoking dialogue about Swiggy’s journey to the public markets. Bothra emphasized the importance of long-term shareholder value, governance, and solid investor relationships in building a sustainable public market presence. He said, \"The IPO journey doesn't start with appointing bankers; it begins years earlier by building trust with investors and strengthening corporate governance. Despite a tough market environment, our strong institutional support and long-term relationships helped us navigate the listing successfully. An IPO isn't just a financial event—it's the biggest marketing event for a company, enhancing consumer awareness and credibility in the public markets.\"A highlight of the day was a riveting fireside chat between Pragya Misra, Public Policy and Partnerships Lead for India, OpenAI and Claire Zau, Partner and AI Lead, GSV Ventures. Delving into OpenAI's journey, Pragya Misra said, \"OpenAI’s mission is to develop Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) for all of humanity, and with India being a significant part of the global population, the company sees the country as pivotal to its global success. OpenAI aims to work collaboratively with the Indian ecosystem, considering local linguistic and cultural diversity when developing AI features.” Misra emphasized that multi-modality AI will play a crucial role in democratizing access to knowledge, particularly in education and healthcare, where AI can make high-quality education more affordable and personalized.The event also included a series of dynamic panel discussions on topics including: The Edtech Edge - How Student Impact Fuels Business Success, Governing AI in the World's Largest Democracy, Beyond the Blueprint: Building India’s Universities of Tomorrow, AI in EdTech: Building Tomorrow's Learning Reality, From Classroom to Capital Markets: Scaling Up Education Companies, Generative AI and the Evolution of Edtech: Transforming Pedagogical Approaches, The Impact of Government Regulations on Transnational Education and more.The 3rd Annual ASU+GSV & Emeritus Summit is a testament to the power of collaboration and dialogue in advancing education and skills development worldwide.",

            "description": "US Indian Migrants Mass Deportation Expenses: अमेरिका ने अवैध रूप से रह रहे 205 भारतीय प्रवासियों को निर्वासित करने के लिए C-17 अमेरिकी सैन्य विमान का इस्तेमाल किया. ये प्रवासी बुधवार (5 फरवरी) को दोपहर को पहुंचेगे. सैन्य विमानों से निर्वासन के इस कदम से ट्रंप प्रशासन की आव्रजन नीति एक बार फिर चर्चा में है. अमेरिका ने अन्य देशों के प्रवासियों को भी निर्वासित करने के लिए चार्टर्ड प्लेन और सैन्य विमानों का इस्तेमाल किया है.सैन्य विमानों के इस्तेमाल पर आने वाला खर्च काफी भारी है. रिपोर्ट्स के अनुसार, C-17 मिलिट्री ट्रांसपोर्ट एयरक्राफ्ट की परिचालन लागत 28,500 डॉलर प्रति घंटा (लगभग 24.82 लाख रुपये) है. एक अन्य अधिकारी ने बताया कि सेना ने इन उड़ानों की कुल लागत की गणना अभी नहीं की है, लेकिन 12 घंटे तक चलने वाली एक उड़ान की अनुमानित लागत लगभग 252,000 डॉलर (लगभग 2.20 करोड़ रुपये) हो सकती है. अमेरिकी सीमा शुल्क और आव्रजन प्रवर्तन (ICE) के अनुसार, 135 निर्वासितों के लिए एक चार्टर्ड उड़ान की लागत 17,000 डॉलर प्रति उड़ान घंटे है, जो कि आमतौर पर 5 घंटे तक चलती है. इसका मतलब है कि प्रति व्यक्ति लागत 630 डॉलर (लगभग 52,000 रुपये) होती है.C-17 और C-130E विमानों की लागतरॉयटर्स की रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक C-17 की परिचालन लागत 21,000 डॉलर प्रति घंटा (2022 के अनुसार) है, जबकि C-130E विमान की परिचालन लागत 68,000 डॉलर से 71,000 डॉलर प्रति घंटा के बीच है. इसका मतलब है कि एक 12 घंटे की C-17 उड़ान की लागत लगभग 252,000 डॉलर हो सकती है, जबकि C-130E की उड़ान की लागत 816,000 से 852,000 डॉलर हो सकती है.निर्वासन के लिए सैन्य विमानों का इस्तेमाल क्यों?इंडियन एक्सप्रेस की रिपोर्ट के अनुसार, सैन्य विमानों का इस्तेमाल करना प्रतीकात्मकता से भरा हुआ है. ट्रंप प्रशासन का मानना है कि ये कदम अवैध आप्रवासियों के खिलाफ सख्त संदेश देने का हिस्सा है. ट्रंप ने अवैध आप्रवासियों को अक्सर 'अपराधी' और 'एलियन' कहा है, जिन्होंने अमेरिका पर 'आक्रमण' किया है. सैन्य विमानों से निर्वासन का दृश्य इस संदेश को सशक्त करता है कि ट्रंप ऐसे अपराधों के प्रति कठोर हैं.ट्रंप का रुख: अवैध प्रवासियों पर सख्तीहाल ही में रिपब्लिकन सांसदों से बात करते हुए, ट्रंप ने कहा, \"इतिहास में पहली बार हम अवैध विदेशियों का पता लगा रहे हैं और उन्हें सैन्य विमान में भरकर वापस उनके देशों में भेज रहे हैं.\" ट्रंप ने जोर देकर कहा कि वह अवैध आप्रवासियों को हिरासत में रखकर लंबे समय तक रुकने के बजाय जल्दी से जल्दी निर्वासित करना चाहते हैं. इस मामले में भारत के लिए डिपोर्टेशन फ्लाइट अब तक की सबसे लंबी निर्वासन उड़ान है. इससे पहले अमेरिका ने ग्वाटेमाला, पेरू, होंडुरास, और इक्वाडोर के लिए भी निर्वासन उड़ानें चलाई थीं. अमेरिका के आव्रजन नीति में नया मोड़अमेरिका की तरफ से गैरकानूनी स्थिति वाले प्रवासियों के सामूहिक निर्वासन में सैन्य विमानों के इस्तेमाल ने आव्रजन नीति में एक नया मोड़ दिया है. ट्रंप प्रशासन ने इस कार्रवाई को अवैध आप्रवासियों के खिलाफ सख्त संदेश के रूप में पेश किया है. हालांकि, इन निर्वासन उड़ानों की लागत बेहद भारी है, जो इस कार्रवाई को और भी चर्चा का विषय बना रही है.ये भी पढ़ें: ट्रंप का इंडिया के खिलाफ बड़ा एक्शन, 'अवैध प्रवासियों' से भरी पहली फ्लाइट भारत के लिए रवाना, C-17 सैन्य विमान से भेजे जा रहे इंडियंस",

This development, reported by Russia's RIA state news agency, could mark a significant shift in the U.S.-Hamas dynamics.According to Mousa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas Politburo member, the organization is open to discussions with the Trump administration and has historically been receptive to engagement with various U.S. administrations, including that of former President Joe Biden. Marzouk made these comments during a visit to Moscow on Monday for talks with the Russian foreign ministry, though the exact timing of the RIA interview remains unclear.Trump outlined a controversial new policy towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, vowing to economically rehabilitate the war-torn Gaza Strip once Palestinians are resettled. Marzouk remarked that given Washington's influence in the Middle East, dialogue with the U.S. has become a vital necessity for Hamas.",

            "description": "शाला दर्पण पोर्टल पर शिक्षा विभाग की प्रोग्रेस रिपोर्ट जारी हो गई है। इसमें कई चौकाने वाले आंकड़े सामने आए हैं। पूरे प्रदेश में शिक्षा विभाग के पास 3 लाख 71 हजार 070 पद हैं, लेकिन इनमें से 2 लाख 54 हजार 243 पदों पर ही कर्मचारी कार्यरत हैं। यानी 1 लाख 16 हजार 827 खाली पड़े हैं। अकेले उदयपुर में 6 हजार से ज्यादा पद खाली हैं। इनमें 5636 पद शिक्षकों, जबकि 500 से अधिक मंत्रालयिक व चतुर्थ श्रेणी कर्मचारियों के हैं। सबसे चौंकाने वाली स्थिति ऑफिस और स्कूलों में चतुर्थ श्रेणी कर्मचारियों के खाली पदों को लेकर है। इनके कुल 27 हजार 986 पद स्वीकृत हैं। इनमें से 22 हजार 685 रिक्त हैं। केवल 5 हजार 301 ही चतुर्थ श्रेणी कर्मचारी हैं। इस कारण कई स्कूलों में तो स्थिति यह है कि उच्चाधिकारी या अन्य गणमान्य के पहुंचने पर शिक्षक को स्वयं पानी पिलाना पड़ता है। प्राथमिक विद्यालयों में तो चतुर्थ श्रेणी कर्मचारियों के पद ही नहीं हैं। खास बात यह है कि इस रिपोर्ट में विभाग ने पांच तरह की भर्तियों का जिक्र भी किया है। हालांकि, इन्हें प्रक्रियाधीन बताया गया है। इसके अलावा 2023 तक हुई भर्तियों का हवाला भी दिया गया है। इसके तहत 13 हजार 586 नई नियुक्तियां होने की बात कही गई है, जबकि 13 हजार 766 पदों पर कर्मचारियों की पदोन्नति का दावा भी किया गया है। वर्ष 2023 के बाद की जो नई भर्तियां प्रक्रियाधीन बताई गई हैं, उनमें व्याख्याताओं के 5582, वरिष्ठ अध्यापकों के 8543, शारीरिक शिक्षकों के 4338, वरिष्ठ शारीरिक शिक्षकों के 136 और बेसिक कम्प्यूटर अनुदेशक के 7124 पद शामिल हैं। इस पूरी भर्ती में चतुर्थ श्रेणी कर्मचारी भर्ती को लेकर कोई जिक्र नहीं है। घट रहा नामांकन, 2021-22 में 98 लाख बच्चे थे, अब 72 लाख ही प्रदेश में 72 हजार स्कूल हैं। उदयपुर में इनकी संख्या 3994 है। कर्मचारियों की कमी के कारण स्कूलों में नामांकन लगातार घट रहा है। नए पद नहीं बढ़ाने और प्रमोशन से ही शिक्षक- कर्मचारियों को अपग्रेड करने से निचले स्तर पर कर्मचारियों की कमी है। विभाग के अंदरूनी सूत्रों की मानें तो सब कुछ ठीक है, लेकिन कुछ आला अफसर दबी जुबान से स्वीकार कर रहे हैं कि पद खाली होने से कई काम प्रभावित हो रहे हैं। बता दें कि सत्र 2021-22 में 98 लाख नामांकन थे। इसके बाद सत्र 2022-23 में घटकर 90 लाख रह गए। सत्र 2023-24 में 79 लाख रहे। चालू शैक्षिक सत्र 2024-25 में 72 लाख का नामांकन है। हालांकि, नामांकन घटने के पीछे प्रवेश के लिए बच्चे की उम्र का दायरा बढ़ाना भी है। अभी 6 वर्ष की आयु पर ही पहली कक्षा में प्रवेश देने की बाध्यता के कारण अधिकांश बच्चे निजी स्कूलों में शिफ्ट हो गए। 1697 जांचें पेंडिंग, विभाग बोला- 50% से ज्यादा पुरानी सरकार की मैन पावर नहीं होने का असर सरकारी कामकाज के अलावा विभागीय शिकायतों और जांचों पर भी पड़ा है। वर्तमान सरकार ने एक आंकड़ा जारी किया है। इसमें प्रदेश स्तरीय 1697 मामलों की शिकायतें और जांचें पेंडिंग हैं। विभाग का बयान है कि 50% से अधिक मामले पुरानी सरकार के हैं, लेकिन सवाल यह है कि सरकार भले ही किसी भी दल की रही, लेकिन विभाग के अधिकारी और कर्मचारी तो उस समय भी थे, फिर ये पेंडिंग क्यों रह गईं? बता दें कि ये पेंडिंग जांचें व्याख्याता, डीईओ, अधिकारियों, फर्स्ट ग्रेड से जुड़े शिक्षक-कर्मचारियों की अनुशासनहीनता, गबन, फर्जी पोस्टिंग, गलत पदोन्नतियां आदि को लेकर हैं। एक्सपर्ट की राय - प्रयोग और नवाचारों के साथ कर्मचारी भी जरूरीरिटायर्ड डिप्टी डायरेक्टर गणेशलाल निनामा कहते हैं कि मैन पावर जरूरी है। केवल प्रयोगों और नवाचार के दम पर ही विभाग का संचालन होता है तो उसका खामियाजा बच्चों को भुगतना पड़ता है। स्कूल हैं, कई प्रयोग हो रहे हैं, लेकिन पढ़ाने के लिए शिक्षक ही नहीं है तो असर रिजल्ट पर भी आएगा। सरकार और विभाग को पहले खाली पदों को भरने पर ध्यान देना चाहिए। उधर, राजस्थान पंचायती राज शिक्षक संघ के प्रदेशाध्यक्ष शेर सिंह चौहान का कहना है कि शिक्षकों के साथ अन्य कर्मचारियों के पद खाली होने से शिक्षकों पर भार आता है। इस रिपोर्ट के बीच यह भी कहा जा रहा है कि मौजूदा सरकार के कार्यकाल में विभाग का ध्यान केवल घोषणाओं, नवाचार और प्रयोगों के दम पर ही वाहवाही लेने का रहा है। तभी तो नई सरकार के कार्यकाल के दौरान बीते एक साल में कुल 18 तरह के प्रयोग विभाग ने किए हैं। इनका हवाला भी रिपोर्ट में दिया गया है। इनमें से प्रमुख ये हैं... एक साल में 18 नवाचार, प्रयोगों व घोषणाओं का जिक्र",

Investors are closely monitoring Beijing's moves to restore confidence.Stocks on the Mainland are expected to open cautiously due to varying trade tariffs initiated by the Trump administration, which have been lower than initially expected.

Meanwhile, the rally in Hong Kong's Chinese stocks and strong movements in AI sectors suggest focused recovery despite prevailing tensions.",

            "description": "Nissan Navigates Tariff Tensions: A Tough Road Ahead Nissan faces a potential crisis as U.S. tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports threaten its profitability in its top market. Analysts suggest the Japanese automaker, already battling financial challenges, stands to suffer significantly if President Trump's proposed 25% levies come to fruition, following a temporary 30-day delay.Unlike competitors Toyota and Honda, Nissan may struggle to pass tariff costs to consumers, as many of its compact models, built in Mexico for the U.S. market, cater to price-sensitive buyers. This issue compounds the challenges Nissan faces as it deliberates a possible merger with Honda to stabilize its position.If the tariffs are imposed, Nissan may need to reroute Mexican-made cars or increase prices to avoid operational losses, while juggling ongoing industry shifts. As the auto sector braces for change, Nissan's next steps could have lasting impacts on its future and merger plans.",

The president deferred their enforcement by a month, contingent on commitments to combat drug trafficking and immigration.Ebrard's comments highlight a collaborative effort to resolve tensions and safeguard economies from potential downturns due to the proposed tariffs.",

            "description": "Santiago Castro's Heroic Strike Propels Bologna to Coppa Italia Semis In a stunning turn of events, Santiago Castro made an immediate impact for Bologna, clinching a late victory against Atalanta in the Coppa Italia quarter-finals.Castro, introduced into the game as a substitute, netted the winning goal just two minutes after setting foot on the pitch, capitalizing on a brilliant free kick by Charalampos Lykogiannis in the 80th minute.Their goalkeeper, Lukasz Skorupski, was instrumental in keeping Atalanta at bay earlier in the match, preserving the clean sheet with a stellar save against Raoul Bellanova. Bologna's triumph secures their spot in the tournament's semi-finals.",

            "description": "FBI Sues DOJ to Shield Identities in Jan. 6 Probe Two groups of FBI employees filed lawsuits against the U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday. They aim to protect the identities of agents involved in investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol storming by Donald Trump's supporters. Concerns are growing as pardoned rioters have started naming agents on social media.The lawsuits came before a deadline set by Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, who ordered the FBI to submit a list of all employees who played a role in the Jan. 6 investigation. Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll confirmed the list would cover thousands of employees, but the submitted list excluded their names, an insider revealed.The Justice Department's intentions with the list remain unclear, while a DOJ spokesperson refused to comment. The lawsuits assert that publishing the list could endanger agents by making them vulnerable to threats from the now-forgiven rioters. The legal action highlights an ongoing tension over the consequences of the Capitol attack investigation.",

            "description": "Federal employees are suing to disconnect a server, reportedly operated by associates of Elon Musk, from the US Office of Personnel Management. A motion filed today as part of a class action suit and obtained by Wired claims that the new server connected to OPM systems is a violation of federal laws as well as a privacy risk for government staffers.The OPM is essentially the federal government's human resources department, and it houses sensitive personal information about current and prospective employees. The email server is reportedly harvesting information from OPM's data systems, according to the initial lawsuit that is seeking to block Musk's access to that private information. Government agencies are required to conduct privacy assessments before making substantial changes to IT systems under the 2002 E-Government Act, but today's motion alleges the OPM did not perform that assessment before the server was installed. On Friday, Reuters reported that senior officials at the OPM were locked out of the department's data systems, ostensibly by Musk's allies. \"We have no visibility into what they are doing with the computer and data systems,\" one of the unnamed officials said. \"That is creating great concern. There is no oversight. It creates real cybersecurity and hacking implications.\"Reuters' sources spoke anonymously with the publication out of fear of retaliation. Interim US Attorney Ed Martin has already posted his support for Musk's activities on X. \"We will pursue any and all legal action against anyone who impedes your work or threatens your people,\" he wrote, referring to the Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk spearheads.The OPM isn't the only government agency where Musk may be installing his connections. Wired separately reported that a former employee of the South African billionaire allegedly has direct access to systems in the US Treasury Department. A group of labor unions and retiree advocates has sued the Treasury for granting DOGE permission to access those systems.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/government-workers-sue-over-potentially-illegal-doge-server-201042201.html?src=rss",
