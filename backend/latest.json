            "description": "Guwahati: Eight Bangladeshi intruders arrested in Bongaigaon district of Assam have disclosed sensational facts about the porous international border and how infiltrators entered Indian territory. The intruders were arrested on 22nd July in Bongaigaon railway station while trying to board a train said that they had entered India through the Meghlaya border at night. The Bangladeshi intruders entered the Indian territory at the night of July 21 and according to them they crossed the border as there were no guards to prevent them. The fencing in the border also collapsed due to heavy rain and it was easy for them to cross it as there were no guards. The intruders who were arrested by railway police told the media that the barbed wire fencing collapsed due to heavy rain and they easily crossed it to the Indian side as there were no guards. Read More: Bihar electoral revision: “SIR reveals 18 lakh dead, 7 lakh duplicate voters,” says ECI They were planning to travel to Chennai to work in a garment factory and crossed the international border from Jamalpur in Bangladesh to Meghalaya. One arrested intruder also said that there may be others who have crossed to Indian territory along with them but they were not in their group. The railway police in Bongaigaon station launched a crackdown after a video went viral where dozens of people suspected to be Bangladeshi nationals were seen roaming in the station premises. So far eight intruders have been arrested, but there is fear that many others are still at large who have crossed the porous border. Meanwhile the local police are at high alert. The arrested intruders were questioned by police for further investigation. But it is for sure that the unmanned border in the hilly terrain of Meghalaya are giving opportunities to the infiltrators to easily cross over to the Indian side.",

            "description": "Calling all gamers with a love of horror films: Hellraiser is getting a video game adaptation. Saber Interactive is turning the cult franchise into a game called Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival. Clive Baker's 1986 novella, The Hellbound Heart, served as the basis for the Hellraiser films. He also wrote and directed the first instalment, which premiered in 1987. Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival is a single-player game that has you play as Aidan while fighting your way through an \"action survival horror experience.\" You also must deal with Pinhead, who's known for harvesting human souls — yeah, this is a creepy game. As Saber Interactive states, \"The Hellraiser universe is defined by its unflinching exploration of pain, pleasure, and the thin and terrifying line that separates the two. That essence is at the heart of our game.\" You can see for yourself in the announcement trailer.The team at Saber Interactive took an additional step to ensure fans of the movie franchise are happy. They spoke with Clive Barker, himself, to maintain an \"authentic\" storyline. There's no word yet on exactly when Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival will launch, but more announcements should come this year. It will be available on theXbox Series X and S, PlayStation 5, and the PC through Steam.

            "description": "On July 22, as Devendra Fadnavis turns 55, Maharashtra pauses to acknowledge the journey of a leader who has reshaped the state’s political contours in the past decade. More than just the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) face in Maharashtra, Fadnavis has grown to embody the party’s aspirations, adaptability, and power play in one of India’s most politically complex states.This is not merely a birthday tribute, but a tracing of the arc of a man who went from being the youngest mayor of Nagpur to a two-time Chief Minister of Maharashtra, deftly navigating caste equations, coalition politics, and the pressures of urban governance with trademark resilience. The Early Years: Political Roots in the RSS EcosystemBorn in Nagpur in 1970 into a Brahmin family with strong ties to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Devendra Fadnavis was steeped in political ideology from a young age. His father, Gangadhar Fadnavis, was a prominent member of the Jan Sangh and later the BJP, offering young Devendra an early glimpse into the world of public life.A law graduate with a management degree, Fadnavis entered electoral politics early. By 22, he was a municipal corporator in Nagpur, and soon after, in 1997, he became the city’s youngest mayor at age 27 — a precursor to his rapid political ascent. Legislative Journey: The MLA with a Technocrat’s MindFirst elected as an MLA from Nagpur West in 1999, and then continuously re-elected from Nagpur South West, Fadnavis quickly established a reputation as a policy-oriented, articulate leader. Whether it was debating urban renewal, fiscal discipline or infrastructure modernisation, he often stood out in the Maharashtra Assembly for his sharp grasp of governance.His stint as state BJP president from 2013–14 positioned him as a frontrunner in the party’s push to dislodge the Congress-NCP regime. The 2014 Breakthrough: Maharashtra’s First BJP CM Without CoalitionIn 2014, riding on the Narendra Modi wave and BJP’s national resurgence, Fadnavis became Maharashtra’s first BJP Chief Minister to complete a full five-year term, a feat in a state known for political churn. At 44, he was the second youngest CM after Sharad Pawar and the first from Nagpur — the ideological nerve centre of the RSS.His selection surprised many, including regional power centres within the party, but the high command favoured his clean image, technocratic credentials, and urban connect. The decision proved strategic, with Fadnavis becoming the BJP’s face of governance and modernisation in Maharashtra. The First Term (2014–2019): Infrastructure, Investment, and Assertive LeadershipAs Chief Minister, Fadnavis pushed an aggressive development agenda. Under his leadership the Mumbai Metro projects gained momentum, the ambitious Samruddhi Mahamarg (Nagpur-Mumbai Expressway) was fast-tracked, ease of doing business rankings improved significantly, the state attracted record foreign direct investment (FDI), urban projects such as the Smart Cities Mission saw active promotion.He also made decisive interventions during droughts, with initiatives like the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan to combat water scarcity.Yet, his assertiveness often came with political cost — particularly in rural Maharashtra and with ally Shiv Sena, with whom relations grew increasingly tense. 2019: A Brief Second Stint and a Political ThrillerThe 2019 assembly elections delivered a fractured verdict. Although the BJP emerged as the largest party, its alliance with the Shiv Sena unravelled dramatically over the CM post. In a twist that gripped the nation, Fadnavis returned for just 80 hours as CM, in a short-lived coalition with Ajit Pawar of the NCP, before the alliance collapsed.It was a rare political miscalculation for a leader known for backroom mastery. But it also paved the way for the formation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government — an unlikely coalition of Shiv Sena (Uddhav), NCP, and Congress. The Role of a Relentless Leader (2020–2022): Shadow CM and StrategistOut of power but not out of relevance, Fadnavis transformed into a hyper-active Leader of Opposition. From exposing alleged corruption in the MVA regime to taking legal battles to the courts, he ensured that the BJP stayed centre-stage even without formal authority.Political observers often referred to him as the “Shadow CM,” with his relentless campaigning, cadre mobilisation, and continued access to national leadership. 2022 and Beyond: Return to Government as Deputy CMIn June 2022, Maharashtra’s politics turned on its head again when Eknath Shinde led a factional split in Shiv Sena, toppling the MVA. In a move that showcased both humility and strategic acumen, Fadnavis agreed to be Deputy Chief Minister under Shinde — a role he embraced with energy.He has overseen Home, Finance, and Urban Development portfolios, continuing to wield immense administrative influence. A New Chapter: Back at the Helm as Chief MinisterIn 2024, following a series of electoral victories and internal recalibrations within the MahaYuti alliance, Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in once again as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra. His return to the top post underscored his enduring relevance and the BJP’s confidence in his administrative and political capabilities. Now leading a government with Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar as key allies, Fadnavis faces the complex challenge of balancing coalition dynamics while pushing forward an ambitious agenda of infrastructure growth, investor confidence, and social welfare. As CM, he has prioritised law and order reforms, youth skilling initiatives, and urban transformation projects like the Mumbai Metro and Pune Ring Road, reaffirming his position as a moderniser with a mass connect. The Brand Fadnavis: Technocrat, Tactician, Team PlayerToday, Devendra Fadnavis stands as a rare blend of technocrat and tactician. Fluent in Marathi, English and Hindi, he connects with multiple demographics — from urban youth to rural karyakartas.He remains a core member of BJP’s national strategy team, often parachuted into other states for election management. In Maharashtra, he is both the architect and the face of the BJP’s long-term plans to establish full dominance.He has weathered political storms, criticism, caste complexities, coalition compulsions, and yet retains the party’s trust — a testament to his adaptive leadership style.As BW Businessworld wishes him on his 55th birthday, the legacy of Devendra Fadnavis is not just in the positions he has held, but in how he has changed the rules of Maharashtra’s political game — with patience, persistence, and purpose.",

Your financial situation is likely to improve, especially if someone who borrowed money from you returns it today. Your loved ones are in good spirits, so consider planning an enjoyable evening with them. Don’t delay expressing your feelings to your partner—tomorrow might be too late. If you're employed, you could face a few challenges at work. Be mindful, as unintentional mistakes may draw criticism from your superiors. For traders, the day looks fairly routine. Some tension might arise due to the ill health of a child or elderly family member, which could affect the harmony in your married life. Remedy: For growth in business and professional life, donate red clothing to those in need.Lucky Colour: Purple.Auspicious Time: 4 pm to 5 pm.",

            "description": "In the ICICI Bank-Videocon loan matter, the Appellate Tribunal under the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act (SAFEMA) has found former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar guilty of accepting a ₹64 crore bribe in return for sanctioning a ₹300 crore loan to the Videocon Group in 2009.This order overturns the earlier clean chit she received from the PMLA Adjudicating Authority and supports the Enforcement Directorate's (ED) provisional attachment of her assets, framing the transaction as a prima facie case of money laundering.The Tribunal underscored a clear conflict of interest in Kochhar's approval of the loan. Shortly after disbursing the funds to a Videocon entity, ₹64 crore was traced to NuPower Renewables Pvt. Ltd. (NRPL), a company promoted by her husband Deepak Kochhar. This sum was funneled via Supreme Energy Pvt. Ltd. (SEPL), which is reportedly linked to Videocon's promoter Venugopal Dhoot. While the Tribunal acknowledged that a final determination rests with the Trial Court, it concluded there was sufficient preliminary evidence to justify the attachment order under money laundering charges.Also Read : Tariff Tensions Escalate: India–US Interim Deal Unlikely Before Deadline, Says ReportThe bench of the Appellate Tribunal, while delivering its findings, stated that it could not accept the justification offered by Chanda Kochhar for presiding over the committee meeting that sanctioned a ₹300 crore loan to the Videocon Group -- an entity she was familiar with. The tribunal observed that Kochhar could not claim ignorance of the relationship and, therefore, her participation in the loan sanctioning process was in clear violation of ICICI Bank's internal rules and policies.The tribunal further noted that immediately after the disbursement of the ₹300 crore loan, a sum of ₹64 crore was diverted to NuPower Renewables Pvt. Ltd. (NRPL), where Deepak Kochhar, the respondent and husband of Chanda Kochhar, was managing the company. He held 95% stakes in Supreme Energy Pvt. Ltd. (SEPL), which in turn controlled NRPL. Notably, V.N. Dhoot resigned from SEPL on January 15, 2009, transferring control of the company to Deepak Kochhar.In its order, the tribunal criticized the Adjudicating Authority for ignoring key material evidence and instead relying on irrelevant considerations. It emphasized that the Authority had disproportionately focused on the shareholding structure of NRPL while overlooking the fact that Deepak Kochhar was the Managing Director and in full control of the company's operations. This was further supported by the statement of V.N. Dhoot recorded under Section 50 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, wherein he categorically affirmed that Deepak Kochhar was running the affairs of the company.In January 2020, the ED initially attached assets worth ₹78 crore belonging to the Kochhars, a decision that was reversed by the PMLA Adjudicating Authority in November the same year. The Appellate Tribunal's latest ruling reinstates the ED's position.Deepak Kochhar was arrested by the ED in September 2020 and later released on bail. In December 2022, both Chanda and Deepak Kochhar were arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), only to be granted interim bail by the Bombay High Court in January 2023. The High Court, in a landmark judgment in February 2024, deemed their arrest unlawful and an abuse of power. (This report has been published as part of the auto-generated syndicate wire feed.

            "description": "भारत और पाकिस्तान के बीच 7 से 10 मई के बीच हुए सैन्य टकराव के बाद दोनों देशों के बीच भले ही युद्ध विराम लागू हो गया हो, लेकिन दोनों ही देशों के बीच ‘छाया युद्ध’ यानी Shadow Boxing लगातार जारी है। ताजा संकेत दोनों देशों द्वारा अपने-अपने सीमावर्ती हवाई क्षेत्र को सैन्य अभ्यासों के लिए सुरक्षित रखने की घोषणाओं से मिले हैं। हम आपको बता दें कि दोनों ही देशों ने अपने-अपने NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) जारी किए हैं, जो यह दर्शाता है कि सैन्य तैयारी जारी है।हम आपको बता दें कि भारतीय वायुसेना की South Western Air Command 23 जुलाई से 25 जुलाई के बीच राजस्थान और गुजरात के सीमावर्ती इलाकों में एक महत्वपूर्ण हवाई युद्धाभ्यास करने जा रही है। यह वही क्षेत्र है जो पाकिस्तान की अंतरराष्ट्रीय सीमा से सटा हुआ है। भारत की यह कवायद साफ तौर पर इस संदेश को दोहराती है कि उसकी सुरक्षा तैयारियां किसी भी स्थिति से निपटने के लिए पूरी तरह सक्षम हैं।इसे भी पढ़ें: पाकिस्तान की परमाणु सुरक्षा में लगी सेंध? किराना हिल्स पर भारत की स्ट्राइक के सबूत सामने आएवहीं भारत के जवाब में पाकिस्तान ने भी अपने मध्य और दक्षिणी हिस्सों के लिए 22-23 जुलाई तक NOTAM जारी किया है। इससे यह स्पष्ट हो जाता है कि पाकिस्तान भी सैन्य गतिविधियों और तैयारियों में पीछे नहीं रहना चाहता। दोनों देशों के इस सैन्य तनावपूर्ण वातावरण में सतर्कता और शक्ति प्रदर्शन की नीति बरकरार है।हम आपको याद दिला दें कि 7 मई को भारत ने ‘ऑपरेशन सिंदूर’ के तहत पाकिस्तान और POK (पाक अधिकृत कश्मीर) में कुल 9 आतंकी ठिकानों पर गहरी और सटीक हवाई हमले किए थे। इस कार्रवाई में भारत ने साफ कर दिया था कि उसका मकसद सिर्फ आतंकी ढांचे को नष्ट करना है, न कि पाकिस्तान की संप्रभुता पर हमला करना।इसके बावजूद पाकिस्तान ने इसे आक्रामकता के रूप में लिया और जवाबी कार्रवाई के तहत ड्रोन और मिसाइलों के जरिये भारत के एयरबेस, सैन्य ठिकानों और नागरिक इलाकों को निशाना बनाया था। इसका जवाब देते हुए भारतीय वायुसेना ने पाकिस्तान के कम से कम 9 एयरबेस और 3 रडार साइट्स को सफलतापूर्वक निशाना बनाया था, जिनमें से कुछ परमाणु प्रतिष्ठानों और कमांड एंड कंट्रोल ढांचे के नजदीक थे।इन हमलों में भारत ने Su-30MKI, राफेल और मिराज-2000 जैसे आधुनिक लड़ाकू विमानों का इस्तेमाल किया था, साथ ही BrahMos, Crystal Maze-2, Rampage और Scalp जैसी आधुनिक मिसाइलों का भी प्रयोग हुआ था। भारतीय हमलों की खासियत यह रही कि हर हमला सटीक, लक्षित और योजनाबद्ध था।दूसरी ओर, दोनों देशों की ओर से किए जा रहे ये सैन्य अभ्यास इस बात का संकेत भी हैं कि मई के संघर्ष के बाद भी हालात सामान्य नहीं हैं। भारत जहां अपनी तैयारी और आक्रामक सैन्य क्षमताओं को स्पष्ट रूप से प्रदर्शित कर रहा है, वहीं पाकिस्तान भी अपनी सैन्य सक्रियता को कम नहीं दिखाना चाहता।देखा जाये तो यह छाया युद्ध केवल सैन्य रणनीति तक सीमित नहीं है। भारत इन अभ्यासों के जरिये पाकिस्तान और अंतरराष्ट्रीय समुदाय को स्पष्ट संदेश दे रहा है कि यदि आतंकवाद के खिलाफ कोई ठोस कार्रवाई नहीं हुई तो वह दोबारा भी ऐसी ही सैन्य कार्यवाहियां करने में संकोच नहीं करेगा। वहीं पाकिस्तान अपनी आंतरिक अस्थिरता और आर्थिक संकट के बावजूद यह दिखाना चाहता है कि वह सैन्य दृष्टि से कमजोर नहीं है।बहरहाल, भारत और पाकिस्तान के बीच यह छाया युद्ध दर्शाता है कि सीमा पर भले ही बंदूकें कुछ समय के लिए शांत हो जाएं, लेकिन कूटनीति और सैन्य तैयारी के स्तर पर तनाव कायम है। भारत स्पष्ट रूप से अपने आतंकवाद विरोधी रुख और सैन्य श्रेष्ठता को दोहराने में पीछे नहीं हट रहा है। आने वाले दिनों में दोनों देशों के बीच यह शक्ति प्रदर्शन का खेल जारी रहेगा, जिसमें कूटनीति और सैन्य रणनीति दोनों ही अहम भूमिका निभाएंगे।",

            "description": "Starting late 2026, visa-free travelers heading to Europe will need to pay more to enter. The European Commission has proposed raising the European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS) fee from €7 to €20. This nearly threefold increase will affect citizens from more than 60 non-EU countries that currently enjoy visa-free access to the Schengen zone, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan—and Indian passport holders who hold long-term visas or residence in these countries. Visa-Free, Not Cost-Free Once operational, ETIAS will require all travelers from visa-exempt countries to apply online before visiting any of the 30 European countries under the Schengen Agreement. This includes Indians living in or holding visas for countries such as the US, UK, or Canada. The updated fee structure is part of a broader push by the EU to align ETIAS with global counterparts such as the US Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) and the UK’s Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA). According to the European Commission, the €20 fee will help finance system operations, upgrades in security infrastructure, and integration with databases such as Interpol and Europol. Application Remains Digital The application process remains simple. Travelers will need to fill out an online form with their personal details and passport information. The system will then automatically screen the information for security, health, and migration concerns. Most approvals are expected within minutes, though applications flagged for review may take longer. There is no need to visit a consulate, and the travel authorisation is valid for multiple short-term stays over a three-year period or until the passport expires, whichever comes first. Who Is Exempt Not every traveler will be affected by the price hike. Children under 18, adults over 70, and certain family members of EU citizens will remain exempt from paying the fee. Non-EU nationals who hold free movement rights within the bloc are also not required to pay. Review and Implementation Timeline The European Council and Parliament now have a two-month window to review the proposal. If no objections or changes are made during this period, the new fee will be implemented alongside the full launch of ETIAS, expected in the final quarter of 2026. EU Cites Security and Parity “The new fee structure brings ETIAS in line with similar systems in other major travel destinations and ensures long-term maintenance and security of the system,” the Commission noted. ETIAS is being positioned as a key component in the EU’s effort to digitise border checks and bolster public safety while maintaining ease of travel for tourists and short-term visitors. Until the system goes live, travelers to Europe from visa-exempt countries, including Indians holding US, UK, or Schengen long-stay visas, will continue to enter the region without paying the higher fee. But from late 2026, budgeting for ETIAS will become a part of the pre-departure checklist.116163879",

As has become tradition, 111 Dot Studios, the developer behind the game, has released a set of alphanumeric codes that unlock premium collectibles, ranging from weapon skins to the ever-popular Diamond Vouchers.This daily drop of freebies is part of the studio's ongoing strategy to keep its battle royale title buzzing with activity, especially after the original Garena Free Fire was banned in India back in 2022. The Max version, with its richer graphics and improved gameplay, has since filled the void, winning over a loyal Indian fanbase.Limited Redemptions, High StakesThe catch? These redemption codes are highly time-sensitive and limited in quantity. Only the first 500 users each day can claim the rewards, and each code is valid for just 12 hours. That scarcity has turned the daily redemption ritual into a digital stampede.Among today’s hottest rewards are the Rebel Academy and Revolt Weapon Loot Crates, along with the highly coveted Fire Head Hunting Parachute. Garena has also thrown in Diamond Vouchers, making today’s codes some of the most desirable in recent memory.How to claim your Garena Free Fire Max lootTo grab the rewards, players need to visit the official Rewards Redemption Site and log in using Facebook, Google, X, or VK credentials. After that, it’s a simple copy-paste job; players enter the 12-character codes into the text box, hit confirm, and wait for the goodies to show up in their in-game mailbox.Currency rewards like gold or diamonds are directly credited to the player's wallet.Garena Free Fire Max Redeem Codes Today (July 22)Here’s a look at today’s Garena Free Fire Max redeem codes for July 22, 2025:FFRPXQ3KMGT9FVTXQ5KMFLPZFFNFSXTPQML2RDNAFV7KXTQ4FFMTYQPXFGX6FF6WXQ9STKY3FFRSX4CYHXZ8NPTF2FWXPLV7FFDMNQX9KGX2FFCBRX7QTSL4FFSGT9KNQXT6FPSTX9MKNLY5XF4S9KCW7KY2FFEV4SQPFKX9FFPURTXQFKX3FFNGYZPPKNLX7FFYNCXG2FNT4FPUSG9XQTLMYFFKSY9PQLWX5FFNFSXTPVQZ7GXFT9YNWLQZ3FFM4X9HQWLM5While many gamers are already sharing their rewards on social media, others are still scrambling to grab theirs before the clock runs out. The urgency is part of the appeal, and Garena knows it. By gamifying the very act of claiming free items, the developers have found a clever way to keep the community engaged day after day.For dedicated players, it’s become more than a routine; it’s a race.",

As birds, cows, and yaks began dying after ingesting it, the founders of Further & Beyond stepped in. Through projects like Zemithang Diaries and The Batti Project, they’ve built a powerful model of change: empowering local communities to tackle waste on their own terms.

            "description": "'ना' सिर्फ एक शब्द नहीं, बल्कि एक ऐसी आदत है जो हमारे जीवन को बदल सकती है। हममें से कई लोग अक्सर विनम्रता के कारण, दूसरों को निराश न करने के डर से या सामाजिक अपेक्षाओं के कारण उन चीजों और कामों के लिए 'हां' कह देते हैं, जो हम वास्तव में नहीं करना चाहते हैं। खासकर भारतीय संस्कृति में, जहां रिश्तों और सामाजिक बंधनों को बहुत महत्व दिया जाता है, 'ना' कहना मुश्किल लगता है। हालांकि, यह एक ऐसी कला है जो हमें अपने समय, ऊर्जा और मानसिक स्वास्थ्य को संरक्षित रखने में मदद करती है। आज ‘गुड हैबिट्स’ कॉलम में जानेंगे कि 'ना' कहने की आदत क्यों जरूरी है। साथ ही जानेंगे कि- यह आदत क्यों महत्वपूर्ण है? 'ना' कहना हमें अपनी सीमाएं तय करने की शक्ति देता है। जब हम हर अनुरोध के लिए 'हां' कहते हैं, तो हम अपनी ऊर्जा और समय का दुरुपयोग करते हैं, जिससे तनाव, थकावट और बर्नआउट हो सकता है। 'ना' कहकर, हम अपने लिए समय निकालते हैं और उन चीजों पर ध्यान केंद्रित करते हैं जो हमारे लिए वास्तव में मायने रखती हैं। यह आदत हमें आत्म-जागरूकता और आत्म-सम्मान सिखाती है, क्योंकि यह हमें अपनी जरूरतों को प्राथमिकता देना सिखाता है। भारतीय समाज में, सामाजिक दबाव हमें दूसरों को खुश करने के लिए प्रेरित करता है। इसलिए 'ना' कहना एक क्रांतिकारी कदम हो सकता है। यह हमें यह समझने में मदद करता है कि हमारी अपनी खुशी और स्वास्थ्य भी उतना ही महत्वपूर्ण है। 'ना' कहने के फायदे 'ना' कहना आपके जीवन में जादू की तरह काम कर सकता है। ग्राफिक में देखिए इसके फायदे- ग्राफिक में दी सभी बातों को विस्तार से समझिए- इस आदत को कैसे अपनाएं? 'ना' कहना शुरू करना आसान नहीं लगता, खासकर अगर आप हमेशा \"हां, ठीक है\" कहने के आदी हैं। लेकिन कुछ छोटे स्टेप्स से आप इसे अपनी जिंदगी का हिस्सा बना सकते हैं। कुछ टिप्स देखिए- छोटी शुरुआत करें: बड़े फैसलों से पहले छोटे-छोटे मौकों पर 'ना' कहने की प्रैक्टिस करें। मिसाल के तौर पर, अगर कोई दोस्त कहे, \"चलो, इस वीकेंड पार्टी में चलते हैं,\" और आप थके हुए हैं, तो कहें, \"माफ करो यार, इस बार नहीं आ पाऊंगा।\" स्पष्ट और विनम्र रहें: 'ना' कहते वक्त साफ बोलें, लेकिन विनम्रता से बोलें। जैसे- \"मुझे बहुत अच्छा लगता अगर मैं मदद कर पाता, पर अभी यह मेरे लिए मुमकिन नहीं है।\" अपनी सीमाएं तय करें: यह सोचें कि आप किन चीजों के लिए तैयार हैं और किनके लिए नहीं। फिर इन्हें दूसरों को बताएं ताकि वे आपकी प्राथमिकताओं को समझें। खुद से सवाल करें: कोई नई जिम्मेदारी लेने से पहले रुकें और पूछें, \"क्या यह मेरे लिए जरूरी है? क्या यह मेरे लक्ष्यों से मेल खाता है?\" गिल्ट को अलविदा कहें: 'ना' कहने पर अपराधबोध होता है? याद रखें, यह आपकी सेहत और खुशी के लिए है। समय के साथ लोग आपकी इस आदत को स्वीकार करेंगे। विनम्रता से 'ना' कहने के तरीके भारत में हम दूसरों की भावनाओं का ज्यादा ख्याल रखते हैं। इसलिए ना कहना मुश्किल होता है। यह भी नहीं समझ आता है कि आखिर ना कैसे कहा जाए। ग्राफिक में कुछ तरीके देखिए, इनकी मदद से आप अपनी बात रख सकते हैं और सामने वाला भी नाराज नहीं होगा- 'ना' न कहने के नुकसान अगर आप 'ना' कहना नहीं सीखते हैं तो आपका बहुत नुकसान हो सकता है। इससे हर दिन आप अपने जरूरी कामों को टालते रहेंगे। आपकी क्रिएटिविटी को नुकसान होगा और अक्सर थके हुए रहेंगे। इससे कई नुकसान हो सकते हैं- बर्नआउट होगा: ढेर सारी जिम्मेदारियां उठाने से आप शारीरिक और मानसिक रूप से थक सकते हैं। जैसे, ऑफिस में हर प्रोजेक्ट ले लिया और घर आने तक हिम्मत ही न बची। नाराजगी होगी: जो काम आप नहीं करना चाहते, उसे करने से आप दूसरों और खुद से चिढ़ने लगते हैं। मौके खो सकते हैं: गैर-जरूरी चीजों में उलझकर आप उन मौकों को मिस कर सकते हैं जो आपके लिए खास थे। सेहत पर असर पड़ेगा: तनाव से नींद पर असर पड़ता है, स्ट्रेस बढ़ता है और बीमारियां दस्तक देती हैं। दुनिया के सबसे सफल लोग कहते हैं 'ना' कई सफल लोग 'ना' कहने की कला में माहिर हैं, जिसने उनकी सफलता में महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभाई है- वारेन बफेट: मशहूर अरबपति निवेशक वारेन बफेट का कहना है कि बहुत सफल लोग लगभग हर चीज के लिए 'ना' कहते हैं। वे केवल उन अवसरों को चुनते हैं जो उनके मुख्य लक्ष्यों के अनुरूप होते हैं। स्टीव जॉब्स: एप्पल के सह-संस्थापक स्टीव जॉब्स ने नवाचार के लिए हजारों विचारों को 'ना' कहा, जिससे एप्पल की अभूतपूर्व सफलता संभव हुई। ओपरा विनफ्रे: मशहूर मीडिया हस्ती ओपरा ने अपनी ऊर्जा और समय को संरक्षित करने के लिए 'ना' कहने के महत्व पर जोर दिया है, जिसने उन्हें अपने करियर और व्यक्तिगत जीवन में संतुलन बनाए रखने में मदद की। 'ना' कहना आपकी ताकत है 'ना' कहना कमजोरी नहीं, बल्कि आपकी ताकत और समझदारी का सबूत है। यह आपको अपनी जिंदगी का कंट्रोल वापस देता है। जैसा वारेन बफेट कहते हैं, \"हर 'ना' के साथ आप सही चीजों के लिए 'हां' कहते हैं।\" आज से इस आदत को अपनाएं। छोटे कदम उठाएं, शायद अगली बार जब कोई अनचाहा काम आए, तो हिम्मत करें और विनम्रता से 'ना' कहें। आप देखेंगे कि यह कितना आजाद और हल्का महसूस कराता है। 'ना' कहकर अपने लिए एक खुशहाल, संतुलित जिंदगी बनाएं। .......................... ये खबर भी पढ़ें गुड हैबिट्स- काम के बीच में ब्रेक लेने की आदत:प्रोडक्टिविटी बढ़ाने की पोमोडोरो तकनीक, जानें क्या है 20-20-20 का नियम आज की भागदौड़ भरी जिंदगी में, जहां हर कोई अपने काम और जिम्मेदारियों में व्यस्त है, खुद के लिए समय निकालना बेहद जरूरी हो गया है। क्या आपने कभी सोचा कि दिन भर कुर्सी पर बैठे-बैठे काम करने से आपका शरीर और दिमाग परेशान हो जाते हैं? पूरी खबर पढ़िए...",

            "description": "बारिश के मौसम में करंट लगने की घटनाएं बढ़ जाती हैं। गीले कूलर, टूटे बिजली के तार या खंभों के संपर्क में आने से करंट लगने और मौत की खबरें आम हो जाती हैं। इलेक्ट्रिक शॉक यानी करंट लगना बेहद खतरनाक स्थिति हो सकती है। कभी यह सिर्फ हल्का झटका होता है, लेकिन कई बार यह जानलेवा साबित होता है। इससे दिल की धड़कन रुक सकती है या शरीर के अंदरूनी अंग गंभीर रूप से प्रभावित हो सकते हैं। सबसे मुश्किल बात तब होती है, जब बाहर से कोई चोट नजर न आए, लेकिन अंदर गहरी क्षति हो चुकी होती है। ऐसे में अगर समय पर सही फर्स्ट एड मिल जाए तो किसी की जान बचाई जा सकती है। तो चलिए, जरूरत की खबर में बात करेंगे कि इलेक्ट्रिक शॉक लगने पर तुरंत क्या कदम उठाने चाहिए? साथ ही जानेंगे कि- एक्सपर्ट: डॉ. बॉबी दीवान, सीनियर फिजिशियन, दिल्ली सवाल- इलेक्ट्रिक शॉक क्या होता है? जवाब- हमारा शरीर बिजली को कंटक्ट करता है। जब कोई व्यक्ति बिजली के सोर्स के संपर्क में आता है तो करंट उसके शरीर के ऊतकों (टिशू) से होकर गुजरता है। इस तरह की चोट को इलेक्ट्रिकल इंजरी या इलेक्ट्रोक्यूशन भी कहा जाता है। सवाल- इलेक्ट्रिक शॉक लगने पर शरीर पर क्या असर होता है? जवाब- जब किसी को इलेक्ट्रिक शॉक लगता है तो इसका असर हल्का झटका भी हो सकता है और गंभीर चोट भी। यह इस बात पर निर्भर करता है कि करंट कितना तेज था, कितनी देर तक शरीर में बहा और किस हिस्से से होकर गुजरा। कई बार शरीर पर बाहर से कोई निशान नहीं दिखता, लेकिन अंदरूनी अंगों को गहरी चोट पहुंच सकती है। सवाल- इलेक्ट्रिक शॉक लगने पर तुरंत क्या करना चाहिए? जवाब- जब किसी को करंट लगे तो सबसे जरूरी है घबराने के बजाय शांत रहकर समझदारी से काम लेना। सबसे पहले यह देखें कि व्यक्ति को अभी भी करंट लग रहा है या नहीं। अगर करंट जारी है तो सीधे उसे छूने की कोशिश न करें, वरना आपको भी झटका लग सकता है। पहले बिजली के सोर्स को बंद करें या लकड़ी जैसी किसी सूखी, नॉन-कंडक्टिव चीज से व्यक्ति को करंट से अलग करें। इसके अलावा कुछ और जरूरी बातों का ध्यान रखना चाहिए। इन्हें नीचे दिए गए ग्राफिक में समझाया गया है। सवाल- अगर किसी को इलेक्ट्रिक शॉक लगे तो बचाने वाले को क्या गलतियां नहीं करनी चाहिए? जवाब- जब किसी को करंट लगे तो उसे बचाने की कोशिश करते वक्त कुछ बड़ी गलतियां नहीं करनी चाहिए क्योंकि इससे आप खुद खतरे में पड़ सकते हैं। इन्हें नीचे दिए ग्राफिक में देखिए- सवाल- इलेक्ट्रिक करंट लगने के कितने समय बाद तक खतरा हो सकता है? जवाब- कई बार करंट लगने के लक्षण तुरंत नहीं दिखते हैं। शॉक के कुछ घंटे बाद भी मसल्स में जकड़न, सांस लेने में तकलीफ या हार्ट रिदम में गड़बड़ी हो सकती है। इसलिए अगर व्यक्ति को बेहोशी, थकान, धड़कन तेज या दर्द जैसे लक्षण महसूस हों तो तुरंत ECG और मेडिकल जांच कराना जरूरी है। सवाल- इलेक्ट्रिक शॉक के बाद किन टेस्ट की जरूरत पड़ सकती है? जवाब- आमतौर पर ऐसी स्थिति में डॉक्टर ECG, ब्लड टेस्ट, स्किन बर्न एसेसमेंट, CT स्कैन या MRI करवाने की सलाह देते हैं, ताकि यह पता लगाया जा सके कि करंट का असर दिल, नसों या शरीर के किसी अंग पर तो नहीं हुआ है। सवाल- घर में करंट से बचाव के लिए कौन-कौन से जरूरी सेफ्टी टिप्स अपनाने चाहिए?जवाब- बिजली से जुड़ी लापरवाही जानलेवा हो सकती है, इसलिए सतर्क रहना जरूरी है। सबसे पहले MCB और ELCB जैसे सेफ्टी डिवाइस जरूर लगवाएं, जो किसी भी गड़बड़ी या करंट लीक होने पर तुरंत बिजली सप्लाई बंद कर देते हैं। इसके अलावा कुछ अन्य सावधानियां भी बरतें। जैसेकि- सवाल- शॉक लगने के बाद शरीर में दर्द या जलन कितने दिन तक रह सकती है? जवाब- अगर करंट से मसल्स, नस या स्किन पर चोट आई है तो उसका दर्द या जलन कुछ दिनों से लेकर कई हफ्तों तक रह सकती है। जलने की स्थिति में घाव धीरे-धीरे भरते हैं। कुछ मामलों में फिजियोथेरेपी की भी जरूरत पड़ती है। ऐसे में ध्यान रखें कि डॉक्टर की सलाह से ही दवाएं और देखभाल करनी चाहिए। खासकर जब जलन गहरी हो या छाले पड़ गए हों। ........................... ये खबर भी पढ़िए.... जरूरत की खबर- आकाशीय बिजली से सावधान:बिजली गिरने के 4 संकेत, घर में हों या बाहर, बरतें 10 सावधानियां, न करें ये 5 गलतियां मानसून की शुरुआत होते ही देश के अलग-अलग राज्यों से आकाशीय बिजली गिरने की घटनाएं सामने आ रही हैं। ये घटनाएं भले ही प्राकृतिक हों, लेकिन कुछ जरूरी सावधानियां अपनाकर इनसे बचाव संभव है। पूरी खबर पढ़िए...",

            "description": "जगदीश धनखड़ के उपराष्ट्रपति पद से अचानक इस्तीफा देने पर विपक्ष सवाल कर रहा है। कांग्रेस महासचिव जयराम रमेश ने X पोस्ट में कहा- इस अप्रत्याशित इस्तीफे में जो दिख रहा है, उससे कहीं ज्यादा है। पीएम मोदी धनखड़ को मन बदलने के लिए मनाएं। यह राष्ट्रहित में होगा। खासतौर पर कृषक समुदाय को बहुत राहत मिलेगी। शिवसेना (UBT) नेता आनंद दुबे ने कहा- स्वास्थ्य कारणों से उपराष्ट्रपति के इस्तीफे की खबर चिंताजनक है। हम उनकी कुशलता की कामना करते हैं। मानसून सत्र का पहला दिन था और उसी दिन उनका इस्तीफा हैरान करने वाला है।इस सरकार में क्या चल रहा है? स्वास्थ्य चिंता का विषय होता तो इस्तीफा सत्र से कुछ दिन पहले या बाद में भी दिया जा सकता था। CPI सांसद पी. संदोष कुमार ने कहा- घटनाक्रम बिल्कुल अप्रत्याशित है और हमें नहीं पता कि इसके क्या कारण हैं। मुझे नहीं लगता कि भारत के राष्ट्रपति इसे स्वीकार करेंगे। धनखड़ की ओर से शुरुआती प्रतिक्रिया हो सकती है। हो सकता है कि वह कुछ घटनाक्रमों से असंतुष्ट हों। रमेश बोले- धनखड़ को बड़ी घोषणाएं करनी थीं जयराम रमेश ने कहा- मैं आज शाम (21 जुलाई) लगभग 5 बजे तक कई अन्य सांसदों के साथ उनके साथ था। शाम 7.30 बजे उनसे फोन पर बात की थी। यह साफ है कि उनके इस्तीफे के पीछे जो दिख रहा है, उससे कहीं ज्यादा है। हालांकि, ये अटकलों का समय नहीं है। रमेश ने कहा कि धनखड़ ने सरकार और विपक्ष, दोनों को समान रूप से आड़े हाथों लिया है। उन्होंने मंगलवार दोपहर 1 बजे कार्य मंत्रणा समिति की बैठक तय की थी। न्यायपालिका से संबंधित कुछ बड़ी घोषणाएं भी करनी थीं। कपिल सिब्बल ने कहा- धनखड़ राष्ट्रवादी और देशभक्त राज्यसभा सांसद कपिल सिब्बल ने धनखड़ को देशभक्त बताया। उन्होंने कहा- धनखड़ ने इस्तीफे के पीछे स्वास्थ्य कारणों का हवाला दिया है, इसलिए इसे स्वीकार किया जाना चाहिए और आगे बढ़ना चाहिए। इस पर आगे कोई चर्चा नहीं होनी चाहिए। सिब्बल ने कहा- मैं व्यक्तिगत रूप से उनके इस्तीफे से खुश नहीं हूं, क्योंकि मैं अब जब संसद जाऊंगा तो उनसे नहीं मिलूंगा। निजी तौर पर मुझे अच्छा नहीं लगा। मेरे उनके साथ बहुत अच्छे संबंध थे। वह अपनी बात कहते थे और कोई बात दिल में नहीं रखते थे। जब मैं राज्यसभा में बोलने के लिए ज्यादा समय चाहता था, तो वह मुझे और समय देते थे। देश के पहले उपराष्ट्रपति जिनके खिलाफ महाभियोग लाया गया था देश में 72 साल के संसदीय लोकतंत्र के इतिहास में धनखड़ पहले ऐसे राज्यसभा के सभापति और उपराष्ट्रपति रहे, जिनके खिलाफ दिसंबर 2024 महाभियोग प्रस्ताव लाया था। जो बाद में तकनीकी कारणों से खारिज हो गया था। विपक्ष धनखड़ पर पक्षपात का आरोप लगाता रहा था। विपक्ष दावा था कि वह सिर्फ विपक्ष की आवाज व उनके सांसदों द्वारा उठाए गए सवालों को दबाते हैं। धनखड़ के पिछले कार्यकाल को देखें तो कई अहम पदों पर रहे लेकिन वे अपना कार्यकाल पूरा होते नहीं देख पाए। एक बार विधायक के तौर पर उनके पांच साल एकमात्र अपवाद है। उपराष्ट्रपति रहते धनखड़ के चर्चित बयान 20 जुलाई पत्नी के जन्मदिन पर पत्रकारों को पार्टी दी सेंट्रल विस्टा प्रोजेक्ट के तहत संसद भवन के बाद सबसे पहले उप-राष्ट्रपति भवन बना। इसी साल जनवरी में बिना किसी शोर-शराबे के धनखड़ ने वहां गृह प्रवेश किया। इस मौके पर वृंदावन के कथावाचक से भागवत कथा करवाई कथावाचक के आग्रह पर 11-18 जुलाई के बीच वृंदावन में आने का वादा किया था, पर नहीं गए। पत्नी सुरेश धनखड़ के जन्मदिन पर रविवार (20 जुलाई) को उप-राष्ट्रपति ने अपने आवास पर संसद टीवी के सभी पत्रकारों को एक पार्टी दी। .......................... जगदीप धनखड़ के इस्तीफे से जुड़ी खबर उपराष्ट्रपति जगदीप धनखड़ ने इस्तीफा दिया: स्वास्थ्य को वजह बताया; संसद सत्र के बीच इस्तीफा देने वाले पहले उपराष्ट्रपति जगदीप धनखड़ ने उप राष्ट्रपति पद से इस्तीफा दे दिया है। उन्होंने स्वास्थ्य कारणों को इस्तीफे की वजह बताया है। वे 74 साल के हैं। धनखड़ का कार्यकाल 10 अगस्त 2027 तक था। राष्ट्रपति को पत्र में उन्होंने लिखा- स्वास्थ्य की प्राथमिकता और डॉक्टरी सलाह का पालन करते हुए मैं भारत के उपराष्ट्रपति पद से तत्काल प्रभाव से त्यागपत्र दे रहा हूं। पूरी खबर पढ़ें...",

            "description": "President Donald Trump stepped up his attack on Barack Obama by posting an AI-generated video of the FBI arresting the former President in the Oval Office. The video begins with Obama saying, \"especially the President is above the law\". It then features many US politicians stating, \"no one is above the law.\" The clip then switches to an AI-generated video of Obama being handcuffed by two FBI agents in the same office he once occupied as the President. Trump can be seen sitting and smiling during the \"arrest\". The fake video ends with Obama standing inside jail, wearing the prison's orange jumpsuit. This controversial video comes days after the Trump administration accused Obama of a \"high-level election fraud\" in 2016. n18oc_world n18oc_crux",

            "description": "New Delhi, Jul 21 (PTI) The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has amended affiliation norms to mandate schools to install CCTV cameras with real-time audio-visual recording at all places other than toilets, an official said on Monday.\"Safety of students is one of the paramount responsibilities of a school and ensure that the students get a safe and cohesive eco-system in the school. The Safety has two aspects- (a) safety from scrupulous unsocietal elements (b) safety for the overall well-being of the children with reference to bullying and other implicit threats.\"All of such probablities can be prevented with a vigilant and sensitive staff and with the usage of the latest technology,\" CBSE Secretary Himanshu Gupta said.To ensure the safety of students in the school premises, the board has made an amendment in Chapter 4 (Physical Infrastructure) of Affiliation Bye Laws-2018 by incorporating a clause about CCTV installation.\"The school should install high resolution CCTV Cameras with audio visual facility at all the entry and exit points of the school, lobbies, corridors, Staircases, all the classrooms, labs, library, canteen area, store room, playground and other common areas except toilets and washrooms with real time audiovisual recording.\"These CCTV Cameras must be equipped with a storage device with the capacity of holding footage of at-least 15 days. It shall be ensured that a backup of a minimum 15 days be preserved, which may be accessed by the authorities, if required,\" Gupta added.As per the Manual on Safety and Security of Children in Schools, NCPCR, \"School Safety\" has been defined as creating a safe environment for children, starting from their homes to their schools and back.\"This includes safety from any kind of abuse, violence, psycho-social issue, disaster: natural and man made, fire, transportation. Emotional safety is especially important because it is often difficult for teachers and parents to detect emotional problems and difficulties in children.\"Bullying can cause victimized students to suffer from lower self-esteem and daily stress about their well-being,\" Gupta said.

Detainees at Miami's ICE jail were reportedly forced to eat like animals while shackled. Overcrowding, medical neglect, and a lack of basic necessities plague facilities in Krome and Broward, exacerbated by Trump's immigration policies.",

            "description": "The railway passengers from the Northeast will have much faster connectivity with other Indian states after the announcement of a second railway bridge over the Brahmaputra in Guwahati. The Second Rail-cum-Road Bridge at Saraighat over the Brahmaputra River has been sanctioned as part of the doubling of the Agthori–Kamakhya railway line under Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR). This major infrastructure project was sanctioned during the FY 2023–24 with a sanctioned estimate of Rs. 1,473.77 crore, and is targeted for completion by December 2029. Also Read: PM Modi to visit UK and Maldives for high-level bilateral meetings from July 23 to 26, aiming to boost trade As part of the progress, detailed estimates have been sanctioned by the Railway Board in February 2024, and the Design Drawing & Report has been finalised and duly approved by the competent authority in March 2025. The geotechnical investigations have been completed for the design of the substructure & superstructure, and an EPC tender has been floated for the construction of the bridge, including approach roads, rail viaducts, earthwork and ancillary works. The tender is expected to be finalised soon, and construction works will start immediately after the same. The project includes the construction of a 7.062 km-long stretch from Agthori to Kamakhya, featuring a 1.3 km-long steel composite girder bridge over the Brahmaputra River. The upcoming bridge will be designed with a double-line railway track on the lower deck and a three-lane roadway with footpaths on the upper deck. The north-end approach of 2.694 km will connect to Agthori station, while the south-end approach of 3.07 km will connect to Kamakhya station. Once completed, the new bridge will significantly enhance line capacity in the section, which is poised for industrial growth. Besides improving connectivity, the project is expected to create substantial employment opportunities for both skilled and unskilled workers in the surrounding areas. The Saraighat Bridge is the first rail-cum-road bridge of the region over the river Brahmaputra in Guwahati. The construction of the steel bridge started in 1958 and has been serving the people of the region and the nation since 1962.",

            "description": "HMD Global, the manufacturer of Nokia-branded phones, is gearing up for a busy season in the budget smartphone segment, with leaks pointing to not just one or two, but a full lineup of affordable devices on the horizon. Leading the charge is the upcoming Pulse 2 series, comprising the HMD Pulse 2, Pulse 2 Plus, and Pulse 2 Pro. According to tipster HMD MEME’S, all three phones will run Android 15 out of the box and feature Unisoc processors, marking a renewed push into the entry-level Android market.HMD \"ACCORD\"- Unisoc T8300U 5G SoC- 4, 6, 8GB of RAMHMD \"MAHUZE\"- Unisoc T7250 SoC- 4, 6 GB of RAM— HMD_MEME'S (@smashx_60) July 19, 2025The base model, HMD Pulse 2, is tipped to sport a 6.67-inch HD+ IPS LCD display with a 90Hz refresh rate. Under the hood, it could house a Unisoc T7200 processor, paired with 4GB RAM and up to 128GB of storage. The camera setup is expected to be modest, with a 13MP main sensor and an 8MP front-facing camera for selfies.Meanwhile, the Pulse 2 Plus sticks with the same display and chipset but brings a 50MP main rear camera for improved imaging. RAM is bumped up to 6GB, and storage options remain at 64GB and 128GB.Pulse 2 Pro Aims Higher With 120Hz Display and 50MP Front CameraAt the top end of the new trio is the HMD Pulse 2 Pro, which appears to offer a few premium touches while staying within budget territory. It’s likely to include a 6.7-inch HD+ LCD with a smoother 120Hz refresh rate, a Unisoc T7250 processor, and either 6GB or 8GB RAM, alongside up to 256GB of storage. Fast charging support is also expected at 20W.The camera department is where the Pulse 2 Pro could shine. The rear setup reportedly adds a macro and depth sensor alongside a 50MP primary camera, while the front camera is also a 50MP shooter, an unusual spec at this price point.Crest 2 and Bold Also in the Works With Unisoc PowerIn addition to the Pulse 2 series, two other phones are believed to be on the way: the HMD Crest 2 and the HMD Bold. Internally codenamed “ACCORD” and “MAHUZE” respectively, these models appear to be targeting slightly different ends of the budget spectrum.The HMD Crest 2 is expected to be the more powerful of the two, equipped with the Unisoc T8300 5G chipset. Built on TSMC’s 6nm process, this chip includes two Cortex-A78 cores at 2.2GHz and six Cortex-A55 efficiency cores at 2.0GHz. Geekbench results show a single-core score of 743 and a multi-core score of 2285, which should deliver decent day-to-day performance for a budget 5G phone. RAM variants could include 4GB, 6GB, and even 8GB.On the other hand, the HMD Bold is likely to feature the Unisoc T7250 processor, based on a 12nm FinFET design. It includes two Cortex-A75 cores at 1.8GHz and six Cortex-A55 cores at 1.6GHz. This model is expected to come with 4GB or 6GB of RAM.No Word Yet on Pricing or Launch DatesThere is no official confirmation from HMD about the release dates or pricing of these upcoming phones. However, with multiple leaks emerging in quick succession, a formal announcement could be around the corner. One thing is clear: HMD is preparing to flood the budget market with options that blend modern specs and affordable price points.",

With over 350,000 synthetic chemicals in use and production set to triple by 2050, researchers propose a four-step framework using eDNA, AI, and remote sensing to detect early warning signs of ecological distress.
