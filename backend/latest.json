For the first time ever, non-fossil fuel sources now power half of the nation’s installed electricity capacity, a dream realised five years ahead of the 2030 target pledged under India’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement. As of June 30, 2025, India’s non-fossil fuel capacity, drawn from renewable energy, large hydro, and nuclear power, has soared to an inspiring 242.78 gigawatts (GW), out of a total installed capacity of 484.82 GW. That’s 50.08 percent, a powerful testament to India’s willpower, vision, and unshakeable commitment to sustainable development. This is more than a number. It is a symbol of hope, of responsibility, and of a nation that refuses to choose between progress and the planet. It is the heartbeat of a new Bharat, one that is proving to the world that economic growth can walk hand-in-hand with ecological balance. In achieving this feat, India is not just meeting goals; it is lighting the way forward for the world. A Monumental Achievement in Climate Action India’s attainment of 50 percent non-fossil fuel capacity is a testament to its ambitious vision and resolute policy framework. Union Minister of New and Renewable Energy, Pralhad Joshi, hailed this milestone as a proud moment for the nation, stating, “In a world seeking climate solutions, India is showing the way. Achieving 50 percent non-fossil fuel capacity five years ahead of the 2030 target is a proud moment for every Indian. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s leadership continues to drive Bharat’s green transformation, paving the path towards a self-reliant and sustainable future.” This achievement reflects the synergy between visionary leadership, robust policy implementation, and the collective will of a nation striving for a cleaner, greener future. In a world seeking climate solutions, India is showing the way. Achieving 50% non-fossil fuel capacity five years ahead of the 2030 target is a proud moment for every Indian. Hon’ble PM Shri @narendramodi ji’s leadership continues to drive Bharat’s green transformation — paving... pic.twitter.com/ydzWErWQNC — Pralhad Joshi (@JoshiPralhad) July 14, 2025 The journey to this milestone has been driven by a combination of innovative policies, technological advancements, and a commitment to inclusive growth. India’s clean energy transition is not merely about reducing carbon emissions but also about fostering equitable development, enhancing energy access, and creating economic opportunities across urban and rural landscapes. By surpassing its NDC target well ahead of schedule, India has reinforced its position as a frontrunner in the global fight against climate change, inspiring other nations to accelerate their own transitions to renewable energy. Also Read: PM Dhan-Dhaanya Krishi Yojana: Everything you should know about the Rs 24,000 crore rural upliftment plan Policy-Driven Progress: The Backbone of India’s Renewable Revolution India’s success in achieving 50 percent non-fossil fuel capacity is rooted in a series of well-crafted policies and programs that have catalysed the growth of clean energy. Flagship initiatives such as the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM), PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, solar park development, and the National Wind-Solar Hybrid Policy have been instrumental in scaling up renewable energy deployment while ensuring inclusivity and economic benefits for diverse segments of society. PM-KUSUM: Empowering Farmers Through Solar Energy The PM-KUSUM scheme has been a game-changer for rural India, empowering millions of farmers by providing access to solar-powered pumps. This initiative has not only ensured energy security for agricultural activities but also promoted sustainable farming practices. By enabling farmers to generate solar energy for irrigation and sell surplus power to the grid, PM-KUSUM has opened new revenue streams, fostering financial independence and resilience in rural communities. The scheme has also supported agrovoltaics, integrating solar panels with agricultural land and feeder-level solarisation, which enhances energy efficiency at the grassroots level. As of 2025, PM-KUSUM has transformed the agricultural energy landscape, making farmers active participants in India’s clean energy revolution. PM Surya Ghar: A Rooftop Solar Revolution Launched in 2024, the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana has democratised access to solar energy by targeting one crore households for rooftop solar installations. This ambitious program has made clean energy affordable and accessible, enabling households to generate their own electricity and reduce dependence on fossil fuel-based power. By fostering decentralised energy generation, PM Surya Ghar has empowered citizens to become “prosumers” both producers and consumers of energy. The scheme has also driven job creation in the solar installation and maintenance sectors, contributing to economic growth while advancing India’s decarbonisation goals. India has achieved what many thought impossible — 50% of its installed power capacity now comes from clean, non-fossil sources. A giant leap towards a greener, self-reliant and sustainable future. #50PercentRenewables 🌱⚡ pic.twitter.com/R4eY2eEFPm — Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) (@mnreindia) July 14, 2025 Solar Parks and Wind Energy: Scaling Up Renewable Capacity The development of solar parks across India has been a cornerstone of the country’s renewable energy strategy. These large-scale installations have facilitated utility-scale solar projects, achieving record-low tariffs and making clean energy more cost-competitive. States like Gujarat and Tamil Nadu have emerged as leaders in wind energy, harnessing their coastal winds to meet evening peak power demands. The National Wind-Solar Hybrid Policy has further optimised renewable energy generation by combining the strengths of solar and wind power, ensuring a stable and reliable energy supply. Together, these initiatives have significantly expanded India’s renewable energy base, contributing to the 184.62 GW of renewable energy capacity (excluding large hydro) as of June 30, 2025. Bioenergy: A Catalyst for Rural Development The bioenergy sector, once a marginal contributor, has emerged as a vital component of India’s clean energy mix. By leveraging agricultural waste, municipal solid waste, and other biomass resources, bioenergy projects have provided clean energy while supporting the circular economy. These initiatives have created significant employment opportunities in rural areas, particularly for women and marginalised communities, thereby promoting social equity. Bioenergy plants have also helped reduce air pollution by [...]",

            "description": "हाल ही में सोशल मीडिया और कई वेबसाइट्स में एक खबर वायरल हुई कि समोसा, जलेबी और कचौरी जैसे स्नैक्स पर चेतावनी लिखी जाएगी। इसमें दावा किया गया था कि स्वास्थ्य मंत्रालय ने ऐसी एडवाइजरी जारी की है, जिसके तहत इन पॉपुलर देसी स्नैक्स पर वॉर्निंग लिखी जाएगी। हालांकि, सरकार ने अब इन दावों को फर्जी बताया है। प्रेस इन्फॉर्मेशन ब्यूरो (PIB) ने लिखा है कि स्वास्थ्य मंत्रालय ने ऐसी कोई एडवाइजरी नहीं जारी की है, जिसमें समोसा, जलेबी या लड्डू जैसे स्ट्रीट फूड को टारगेट किया गया हो। यह एक कॉमन एडवाइजरी है, जिसका मकसद लोगों को खाने-पीने की चीजों में छिपे एक्स्ट्रा फैट और शुगर के बारे में जागरूक करना है। यह एडवाइजरी खासतौर पर ऑफिस और वर्क प्लेस में हेल्दी फूड चॉइस को बढ़ावा देने के लिए है। इसका भारतीय स्ट्रीट फूड कल्चर से कोई लेना-देना नहीं है। सरकार ने भले ही यह एडवाइजरी नहीं जारी की है कि समोसा, जलेबी आदि स्नैक्स पर वॉर्निंग लिखनी जरूरी है। इसके बावजूद ये बेहद खतरनाक हैं। खराब तेल और ढेर सारी चीनी में बनी ये चीजें हमें लगातार बीमार बना रही हैं। इसलिए ‘जरूरत की खबर’ में आज समोसा, जलेबी और कचौरी जैसे स्नैक्स की बात करेंगे। साथ ही जानेंगे कि- एक्सपर्ट: डॉ. शिवम खरे, कंसल्टेंट, गैस्ट्रोएंटेरोलॉजी, सर गंगाराम हॉस्पिटल, दिल्ली सवाल: समोसा, जलेबी जैसे खराब स्नैक्स का हमारे ऊपर क्या असर पड़ रहा है? जवाब: हमारे खराब खानपान का नतीजा यानी भारत में लाइफस्टाइल बीमारियों का हाल देखिए। साल 2021 में भारत सरकार द्वारा किए गए नेशनल फैमिली हेल्थ सर्वे के मुताबिक, भारत के लगभग 23% पुरुषों और 24% महिलाओं का वजन सामान्य से ज्यादा है। BMC पब्लिक हेल्थ की एक स्टडी के मुताबिक, भारत में 31.5 करोड़ लोगों को हाइपरटेंशन है। भारत में 10.1 करोड़ लोगों को डायबिटीज है, जबकि 15.3% वयस्क ऐसे हैं जिन्हें प्रिडायबिटीज है। इसका मतलब है कि ये जल्द ही डायबिटीज की लिस्ट में शामिल हो सकते हैं। इन सभी लोगों को को हार्ट अटैक और स्ट्रोक का खतरा भी है। खराब खानपान का सीधी असर लोगों की बिगड़ती सेहत पर दिख रहा है। शहरों में अस्पताल और बेड हर साल बढ़ रहे हैं, पर मरीजों की कतारें उससे तेजी से लंबी हो रही हैं। सवाल: क्या समोसा, जलेबी और कचौरी जैसे देसी स्नैक्स भी खतरनाक हैं? जवाब: इन स्नैक्स में ज्यादातर चीजें तली हुई, ज्यादा मीठी या रिफाइंड होती हैं। इन्हें अधिक मात्रा में खाने से या अक्सर खाने से शरीर को जरूरी पोषक तत्व नहीं मिल पाते हैं। इसके उलट वजन बढ़ता है, कोलेस्ट्रॉल लोवल बढ़ता है, डायबिटीज और दिल की बीमारियों का खतरा बढ़ जाता है। इन चीजों का ग्लाइसेमिक इंडेक्स बहुत ज्यादा होता है यानी ये शरीर में जाकर बहुत जल्दी शुगर लेवल बढ़ाते हैं। ढेर सारा खराब फैट जमा हो जाता है और बीपी भी बढ़ता है। सवाल: समोसा, जलेबी, कचौरी जैसे सभी पॉपुलर इंडियन देसी स्नैक्स इतने नुकसानदायक क्यों हैं? जवाब: इन चीजों को नुकसानदायक बनाते हैं, इन्हें बनाने में इस्तेमाल होनी वाली चीजे- मैदा: जो रिफाइंड फ्लोर है, इससे फाइबर, विटामिन और मिनरल्स निकल जाते हैं। रिफाइंड तेल: ये तेल बार-बार इस्तेमाल होने से ट्रांस फैट्स में बदल सकता है। चीनी: खासकर जलेबी में बहुत अधिक मात्रा में शुगर होती है, जो सीधे ब्लड ग्लूकोज बढ़ाती है। आलू: इसमें ढेर सारा कार्बोहाइड्रेट होता है और न्यूट्रिशन बहुत कम होता है। सवाल: बार-बार तेल गर्म करने या डीप फ्राई करने से क्या होता है? जवाब: बार-बार तेल गर्म करने से उसमें ट्रांस फैट और एक्रिलामाइड नाम का एक हानिकारक कंपाउंड बनता है। ये लिवर, किडनी और दिल पर बुरा असर डाल सकते हैं। ऐसे तेल से बने खाने में ऑक्सीडेटिव स्ट्रेस ज्यादा होता है, जिससे शरीर की कोशिकाएं जल्दी डैमेज होती हैं। ये इंफ्लेमेशन और कैंसर जैसी खतरनाक बीमारियों का कारण बन सकता है। सवाल: इन्हें थोड़ा हेल्दी बनाने के क्या आसान विकल्प हैं? जवाब: अगर देसी स्नैक्स का स्वाद छोड़ना मुश्किल है, तो उन्हें हेल्दी बनाने के तरीके अपनाएं। डीप फ्राई की बजाय एयर फ्राई या बेक करें। मैदे की जगह आटा या मल्टीग्रेन आटा लें। रिफाइंड तेल की बजाय सरसों, मूंगफली या ऑलिव ऑयल बेहतर हैं। चीनी की जगह सीमित मात्रा में गुड़ या शहद इस्तेमाल करें। समोसे में आलू की जगह मिक्स वेज या पनीर भरें। मिठाई की क्रोविंग हो तो फ्रूट चाट या बेक्ड मिठाई ट्राई करें। सवाल: क्या स्वाद और सेहत दोनों का बैलेंस संभव है? जवाब: डॉ. शिवम खरे कहते हैं कि बिल्कुल संभव है। स्वाद और सेहत दोनों साथ चल सकते हैं, बस थोड़ा सोच-समझ कर खाना जरूरी है। मसाले वही रखें, बस इन्हें पकाने का तरीका बदलें। स्वाद को बनाए रखने के लिए कम मात्रा में खाएं लेकिन ताजे और साफ तरीके से बने स्नैक्स खाएं। बच्चों को हेल्दी वर्जन का स्वाद धीरे-धीरे सिखाएं, जैसे बेक्ड समोसा या गुड़ से बनी मिठाई खिलाएं। सवाल: क्या हफ्ते में एक-दो बार समोसा, जलेबी खाना भी नुकसानदायक है? जवाब: हां, बिल्कुल है, लेकिन अगर आप सेहतमंद हैं और बाकी खानपान संतुलित है तो हफ्ते में एक बार थोड़ी मात्रा में खाया जा सकता है। अगर हाई बीपी, डायबिटीज या मोटापा है तो इसे हफ्ते में भी नहीं खाना चाहिए। क्योंकि हर बार इनसे शरीर में ट्रांस फैट, शुगर और कैलोरी का लोड बढ़ता है, जो धीरे-धीरे बीमारियों का कारण बनता है। सवाल: क्या बच्चों के लिए ये स्नैक्स ज्यादा खतरनाक हैं? जवाब: हां, क्योंकि बच्चों का मेटाबॉलिज्म और इम्यून सिस्टम विकसित हो रहा होता है। ज्यादा फैट, चीनी और डीप फ्राई चीजें उनके वजन, दांतों और ब्लड शुगर को जल्दी प्रभावित करती हैं। इसलिए बचपन से ही हेल्दी खाने की आदत डालना जरूरी है। सवाल: अगर रोज वर्कआउट करें तो क्या फिर भी ऐसे स्नैक्स से खतरा रहता है? जवाब: वर्कआउट शरीर को एक्टिव रखता है, पर खराब फैट्स, शुगर और ट्रांस फैट का नुकसान वर्कआउट से पूरी तरह नहीं रुकता। एक्सरसाइज जरूरी है, लेकिन वह खराब खानपान का कम्पन्सेशन नहीं हो सकती है। सवाल: कितनी मात्रा में चीनी, तेल या मैदा सुरक्षित माना जाता है? जवाब: WHO के मुताबिक, रोज की कैलोरी में चीनी 5% से ज्यादा न हो यानी लगभग 5-6 चम्मच बहुत है। इसमें वह चीनी भी शामिल है, जो किसी फल या मीठी चीज को खाने से मिलेगी। तेल 3-4 चम्मच तक ठीक है, बशर्ते वह हेल्दी फैट होना चाहिए। मैदे की कोई न्यूनतम सुरक्षित सीमा नहीं है, इसे कम से कम खाना ही सही है क्योंकि इसमें फाइबर नहीं होता है। .......................... ये खबर भी पढ़ें जरूरत की खबर- दांत पीले क्यों पड़ते हैं: क्या सफेद दांत ही होते हैं हेल्दी, डेंटल एक्सपर्ट से जानें सफेद दांतों का मिथ और सच्चाई हममें से ज्यादातर लोग दांतों की सफेदी को ही उनकी सेहत और सफाई का पैमाना मानते हैं। जब कोई मुस्कुराते हुए चमकते सफेद दांत दिखाता है तो हमें लगता है कि उसके दांत बिल्कुल हेल्दी होंगे। पूरी खबर पढ़िए...",

            "description": "सवाल- मैं अपने परिवार के साथ दिल्ली में रहती हूं। मेरी 11 साल की एक बेटी है। जब वह 3 साल की थी तो हमें उसे कुछ वक्त के लिए छोड़कर बाहर जाना पड़ा। मेरे पति की मस्कट में जॉब थी। मुझे भी उनके साथ जाना पड़ा। हम 6 साल बाहर रहे और उस दौरान वह हमारी जेठ-जेठानी के साथ रही। 6 सालों में हमारा एक-दो बार ही इंडिया आना हुआ। हालांकि स्काइप और फोन पर हमारी बातें होती थी, लेकिन फिर भी शायद हमारे बीच उतनी अच्छी बॉन्डिंग नहीं बन पाई। जब हम लौटकर आए तो बेटी वो घर छोड़कर हमारे साथ दिल्ली आने को तैयार नहीं थी। शायद वो उसे ही अपना असली घर समझने लगी थी। गलती हमारी भी है कि बच्ची को इतनी कम उम्र में अकेले नहीं छोड़ना चाहिए था। लेकिन हम भी मजबूर थे, हमारे पास कोई विकल्प नहीं था। पिछले 2 साल से वह हमारे साथ है, लेकिन हमें लगता है कि उसका व्यवहार उसकी उम्र के बच्चों जैसा नहीं है। वह बाहर जाकर बच्चों के साथ खेलना पसंद नहीं करती, हमेशा अपने कमरे में रहती है। वह पढ़ने में अच्छी है, ध्यान से पढ़ाई करती है। लेकिन बाकी उसकी हरकतें और आदतें उसके उम्र के बच्चों जैसी नहीं हैं। जैसे कहीं भी उसे लेकर जाना चाहो, बर्थडे पार्टी या फैमिली फंक्शन तो वो हमेशा मना ही करती है। अगर हम जिद करके ले भी जाएं तो एक कोने में बैठी रहती है। किसी से घुलती-मिलती नहीं है। मैंने अपने जेठ-जेठानी से इस बारे में बात की। उनका कहना है कि पहले तो ऐसा नहीं था। अभी तुम लोग जब से उसे दोबारा अपने साथ जबरदस्ती लेकर गए हो, तभी ऐसा हो रहा है। कृपया मुझे बताएं कि हम क्या करें कि बच्ची हमको वापस अपने पेरेंट्स की तरह स्वीकार करे। हम पर वापस विश्वास करे और हमारे बीच फिर से पहले जैसा कनेक्शन बन सके। एक्सपर्ट: डॉ. अमिता श्रृंगी, साइकोलॉजिस्ट, फैमिली एंड चाइल्ड काउंसलर, जयपुर जवाब- आपकी बातों से साफ है कि आप एक संवेदनशील और जागरूक मां हैं। जो हुआ, वह उस समय की परिस्थितियों और मजबूरी का हिस्सा था। लेकिन आज आप अपनी बेटी की भावनात्मक स्थिति को लेकर चिंतित हैं और उससे दोबारा जुड़ने की कोशिश कर रही हैं। यह बहुत ही अच्छी बात है। आपकी बच्ची का व्यवहार बताता है कि वह अंदर ही अंदर एक गहरे भावनात्मक संघर्ष से जूझ रही है। इतनी छोटी उम्र में माता-पिता से अलग होना और पूरे 6 साल एक अलग परिवार के साथ रहना उसके लिए एक बड़ा ट्रॉमा हो सकता है। भले ही वह इसे खुलकर जाहिर न कर पाए। बचपन में बच्चा जिनके साथ दिन-रात बिताता है, जिनसे उसे इमोशनल सिक्योरिटी मिलती है, वही उसके लिए अपने बन जाते हैं। आपकी बेटी ने भी अपने बड़े पापा-मम्मी के साथ एक गहरा अटैचमेंट बना लिया था। अब अचानक उस सुरक्षित घेरे से निकलकर एक नई स्थिति में आ जाना, भले ही वो अपने असली माता-पिता के पास ही क्यों न हो, उसके लिए असहज और उलझाने वाला हो सकता है। वह बदलाव को अब भी पूरी तरह स्वीकार नहीं कर पाई है। ये जरूरी नहीं कि वह अपने मन की बात आपको शब्दों में बता पाए। बच्चों की भावनाएं अक्सर उनके व्यवहार के जरिए ही सामने आती हैं। जैसे खुद को कमरे तक सीमित कर लेना, बाहर खेलने से बचना या सोशल इवेंट्स में हिस्सा न लेना। लेकिन अच्छी बात यह है कि बच्ची का दिमाग अभी डेवलपिंग स्टेज में है। तो सही समझ, प्यार और धैर्य के साथ आप उसका विश्वास दोबारा जीत सकती हैं और आपके रिश्ते फिर से मजबूत हो सकते हैं। इसके लिए जरूरी है कि आप कुछ बातों का ध्यान रखें और लगातार छोटे-छोटे प्रयास करें। इसमें समय लगेगा, लेकिन धीरे-धीरे बदलाव जरूर आएगा। आइए, अब इन पॉइंट्स को समझते हैं। बच्ची के इमोशनल ट्रॉमा को समझें आपने बच्ची को जन्म दिया है, लेकिन उसके बचपन की गहरी यादें किसी और के साथ जुड़ी हैं। ऐसे में जरूरी है कि आप उसकी इस भावनात्मक स्थिति को समझें, न कि उसे जज करें। उसकी भावनाओं को स्वीकार करना ही उसके साथ रिश्ता दोबारा बनाने की पहली और सबसे जरूरी सीढ़ी है। उसकी बात बिना टोके और बिना सलाह दिए ध्यान से सुनें जब वह कुछ बोले, चाहे वो स्कूल की बात हो या कुछ और तो बिना रोकटोक उसे बस सुनें। हो सकता है कि वह बहुत कुछ न कहे, लेकिन जब उसे लगेगा कि कोई उसे जज नहीं कर रहा तो वह धीरे-धीरे खुलने लगेगी। हर दिन कुछ वक्त सिर्फ उसके लिए ही निकालें आपकी बेटी को यह भरोसा चाहिए कि अब आप सच में हर दिन, हर पल उसके साथ हैं। इसलिए दिन का कोई एक वक्त ऐसा जरूर चुनिए, जब न टीवी हो, न फोन बस आप, आपके पति और आपकी बेटी एक साथ हों। साथ में बैठकर खाना खाएं, टहलने जाएं, कोई गेम खेलें या बस बातें करें ये छोटी-छोटी मुलाकातें धीरे-धीरे उसके मन में आपकी जगह फिर से मजबूत करेंगी। उसकी पसंद-नापसंद समझें उसे क्या खाना पसंद है, कौन सी फिल्में देखना पसंद है, क्या नहीं खाना चाहती जैसी हर छोटी-छोटी बातों का ध्यान रखें। इन सवालों को ऐसे पूछिए जैसे कोई दोस्त पूछता है। जब उसे ये महसूस होगा कि आप उसकी इंटरेस्ट में दिलचस्पी ले रहे हैं, न कि उसे बदलने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं, तब वो भी आपको अपने मन की दुनिया में धीरे-धीरे शामिल करने लगेगी। पुरानी तस्वीरें, यादें और बातें शेयर करें कभी-कभी उसके साथ बैठकर उसके बचपन की तस्वीरें देखें। मुस्कुराते हुए कहिए, ‘देखो, जब तुम छोटी थी तो ऐसे मुस्कराती थी... ऐसे सोती थी...।’ ये छोटे पल उसे यह महसूस कराएंगे कि आप सिर्फ अब उसके साथ नहीं हैं, बल्कि तब भी थे, जब वो बहुत छोटी थी। इन यादों के जरिए आप उसकी भावनाओं से दोबारा जुड़ सकते हैं। उस पर दबाव न बनाएं, बल्कि स्पेस दें जब वह बात न करना चाहे या अपने कमरे में रहना चाहे तो उसे थोड़ा स्पेस दीजिए। हर बार ये जरूरी नहीं कि वह कुछ छुपा रही है या गलत कर रही है। कई बार बच्चे अपने भीतर की उलझनों को खुद समझने की कोशिश करते हैं। उसे थोड़ा स्पेस देना, यह जताता है कि आप उसके बदलावों को समझते हैं और उस पर भरोसा करते हैं। भरोसा ही रिश्ते की बुनियाद होती है। उसे जो करना अच्छा लगता है, उसमें उसे सपोर्ट करें अगर उसे पढ़ना अच्छा लगता है तो उसके लिए कहानियों की नई किताबें लाइए। अगर वह पेंटिंग या ड्रॉइंग करती है तो उसकी बनाई चीजों को फ्रेम करके दीवार पर लगाइए। जब आप उसके इंटरेस्ट को सपोर्ट करते हैं तो उसे ये महसूस होता है कि आप उसके अपने हैं। यही एहसास उसे धीरे-धीरे आपके करीब लाता है। अपनी गलती स्वीकार करें आप बच्ची को अपनी मजबूरियां भी बता सकती हैं कि आपने उसे अकेला क्यों छोड़ा था। आप कह सकती हैं कि ‘हां, हमें तुझे उस उम्र में छोड़ना नहीं चाहिए था। लेकिन हम मजबूर थे। अब हम चाहते हैं कि तुम्हारे हर पल में हम हों‘। यह मानना कि गलती हुई, बच्ची को आपकी सच्चाई से जोड़ता है। बच्चे से जुड़ने की चाह में इन बातों का रखें खास ध्यान कई बार पेरेंट्स जाने-अनजाने में ऐसे व्यवहार करने लगते हैं, जो रिश्ते को ठीक करने की जगह और उलझा देते हैं। इसलिए जितना जरूरी यह जानना है कि क्या करें, उतना ही जरूरी है यह समझना कि क्या नहीं करना चाहिए। तो ये 5 गलतियां बिल्कुल न करें। उसे अपने बड़े पापा-मम्मी से दूर न करें आपकी बेटी ने अपने जीवन के शुरुआती साल अपने बड़े पापा-मम्मी के साथ बिताए हैं। उनके साथ उसका रिश्ता अपनेपन का है। इसलिए बच्ची को उनसे मिलने-जुलने की पूरी आजादी दें। हफ्ते में एक बार उन्हें घर बुला लें या वीकेंड पर बेटी के साथ उनके घर जाएं। जब आप खुद यह अपनापन दिखाएंगी और उससे कहेंगी कि ‘हमें पता है कि तुम्हें उनके साथ रहना अच्छा लगता था, वो भी तुम्हारा परिवार है’ तो वह खुद को आपके और उनके बीच बंटा हुआ नहीं, बल्कि दोनों जगह सुरक्षित महसूस करने लगेगी। अंत में यही कहूंगी कि बच्चों का भरोसा धीरे-धीरे लौटता है, ये एक दिन का काम नहीं होता है। आपका धैर्य, सच्चा प्यार और सपोर्ट ही उसकी हीलिंग की सबसे बड़ी दवा है। .....................पेरेंटिंग की ये खबर भी पढ़िए पेरेंटिंग- अमीर बच्चों की संगत से बिगड़ रहा बच्चा: बच्चे को बिना डांटे बुरी संगत से कैसे बचाएं, पेरेंटिंग साइकोलॉजिस्ट के 7 सुझाव सवाल- मैं हरियाणा का रहने वाला हूं। मेरा बेटा 11वीं क्लास में पढ़ता है। शुरुआत में वह पढ़ने में काफी अच्छा था, लेकिन पिछले कुछ समय से पढ़ाई में उसका मन नहीं लग रहा है। स्कूल में शायद ऐसे लोगों से उसकी दोस्ती हो रही है, जो बहुत अमीर घरों से आते हैं। उसका रहन-सहन और खानपान बदल रहा है। ये बात हम उसे कैसे समझाएं कि पेरेंट्स से ज्यादा दोस्तों के नजदीक होना और उन पर भरोसा करना ठीक नहीं है। कृपया मुझे इस स्थिति से निपटने के लिए मार्गदर्शन करें। पूरी खबर पढ़िए...",

            "description": "Escalating Tensions: Israel Strikes Damascus Amid Druze Conflict Amid increasing regional tensions, Israel launched a potent series of airstrikes in Damascus on Wednesday, targeting a section of the defense ministry and striking near the presidential palace. This military action signifies a significant escalation against the Islamist-led government of interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa.The Israeli government has emphasized its determination to protect the Druze community in southern Syria from attacks by government forces. This move comes despite Syria's administration deepening ties with the U.S. However, Israel firmly opposes the Islamist rule under the Syrian government. The United Nations Security Council is poised to confront this growing conflict on Thursday.Tensions have peaked in the city of Sweida, primarily inhabited by the Druze minority, as they clash with Syrian government troops and Bedouin tribes. The ongoing violence has drawn international attention, with world leaders calling for immediate actions to cease hostilities and protect civilians affected by the warfare.",

            "description": "Brazil Promises Affordable Solutions for COP30 Accommodations Amid High Demand As the United Nations climate summit, COP30, approaches, Brazil has declared its readiness to provide sufficient accommodations in Belem, the host city, despite the initial shortfall in listings. The government has strategized to meet the demands of delegations, particularly from developing nations, by ensuring affordable lodging options.Valter Correia, Brazil's special secretary for COP30, emphasized the importance of accessibility, stressing that smaller nations most affected by climate change should not be excluded due to cost barriers. Brazil, hosting the event for the first time in years, focuses on raising awareness about deforestation and the Amazon through this platform.Efforts for additional accommodations include utilizing private homes, hotels, schools, and cruise ship cabins. Moreover, a new booking site offers discounted rates for developing countries, with plans to expand availability to all attendees soon. Price gouging remains a concern, but Brazil aims to address it while balancing the economic aspects.",

            "description": "Threads is testing letting you sign up with a Facebook account rather than an Instagram account. The new option, spotted by Social Media Today, doesn't appear to be widely available yet, but is already mentioned in a Meta support article.Besides making it easier for people who don't have an Instagram account to quickly create an account on Meta's X and Bluesky competitor, this new Facebook sign up option should influence the kind of posts and ads that get recommended to you.\"Signing up to Threads with your Facebook account helps unlock features that work across Threads and Facebook, like using the same login info to access both apps,\" Meta writes in a support article. \"If you create a Threads profile with your Facebook account, we’ll combine your info across Threads and Facebook.\"Encouraging users to build their Threads profile using the information and followers they had on Instagram was one of the ways Meta quickly grew its Threads user base. It hasn't always led to the best experience on Threads, though. As it turns out, growth-obsessed Instagram users produce fairly shallow text posts. And because most people's Instagram accounts are associated with their Threads profile, they get served a lot of that subpar engagement bait by default. If you came to Threads looking for the relative wit of X, you'd come away pretty disappointed.Letting you sign up with Facebook will likely have its own shortcomings (namely, modern Facebook is pretty spammy, too), but it at least acknowledges that what people want from Instagram is different from what they want from Threads. Meta has made a concerted effort as of late to establish Threads as more of an independent entity. Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram at Meta, shared that the company planned to remove \"the Instagram graph import from the onboarding flow\" back in November 2024. Threads also started testing using its own separate direct messaging inbox in June, after relying on Instagram DMs since launch.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-is-testing-facebook-account-sign-ups-191214734.html?src=rss",

            "description": "Google will host its next Made by Google event on August 20, the company announced today. In a media invite the search giant shared with Engadget, it promised the event would feature new Pixel phones, watches, buds \"and more.\" At its annual hardware event last year, Google announced the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, Pixel Watch 3 and Pixel Buds Pro 2. Between the company's invite and what came out of last year's event, expect a refresh of nearly the entire Pixel line. As for what the \"and more\" bit could entail, recent rumors suggesting Google is working on a proper response to Apple's MagSafe tech dubbed Pixelsnap. Android manufactures have been slow to adopt the Qi2 wireless charging standard, but with the upcoming Pixel 10 it appears the company is working on a host of magnetic Qi2 accessories, including a new charging stand. As always, be sure to visit Engadget on the day of the event as we'll have a liveblog of the entire proceedings.

            "description": "The Southeast Asian nation of Thailand is undergoing a major political turmoil, where the nation has witnessed three Prime Ministers’ in 3 days. The political upheaval is an outgrowth of the border tensions with Cambodia and the consequent phone calls between the ousted Thai PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra and Cambodian leader. The nation is also boiling under intense anti-government protests over the leaked phone call that put Thailand’s sovereignty and security at stake. Unexpected and untimely regime change is not new to Thailand’s political landscape. The country which runs under constitutional monarchy since 1932 is in itself a byproduct of a military coup. Since then, the nation has witnessed nearly 12 successful military coups and regime changes, predominantly stimulated by the elite conservative or the royalist political factions of the country. However, the latest political row and change of Prime Ministers’ is an impact of the border tension escalated with Cambodia. What Led to the Change of Leadership? Cambodia is the Southeast neighbour of Thailand and both nations share a long 800km border. The nations have border disputes over several areas all along the border such as the Preah Vihear Temple, Emarald Traingle and other regions, which is more than a century old. Cambodia even took the border dispute to the International Court of Justice(ICJ), however Thailand doesn’t recognize the ICJ verdict. In the year 2000, both the nations established Joint Border Commission, but there are little to no progress. Also Read: Donald Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’: A burden for domestic economy and the diaspora? In the latest phase of outbreak, Thailand and Cambodia exchanged gunfire in the disputed Chong Bok Pass border region that led to the death of a Cambodian soldier in the month of May. Few days after the border clash, the Cambodian side leaked an audio clip in which the then-Prime Minister of Thailand Paetongtarn Shinawatra is begging the Cambodian leader over a phone call on June 18th. Shinawatra has addressed the President of Cambodia Hun Sen as ‘Uncle’ and she has vowed to ‘take care of anything he wants’. More humiliating aspect is, over the phone call with her Cambodian counterpart, Shinawatra has accused Thailand’s Army Commander as responsible for the border dispute and has cited that the Army Commander is siding with the opposition party of Thailand. This leaked phone conversation stimulated the political uproar in Thailand. Soon after the audio leak, the second-largest party of the ruling coalition of Thailand withdrew their support for the government and accused Shinawatra government for ‘compromising Thailand’s honor, national dignity, people and military’. Following this, a group of senators appealed to the Constitutional Court to remove Shinawatra from power. Consequently, she was suspended by the constitutional court. Thereby, the Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand Suriya Jungrungreangkit took charge as the Prime Minister of the nation. But, he could sustain only for a day. The next day, the ruling coalition appointed the Interior Minister Phumtham Wechayachai as the Prime Minister, who is a key political kingpin of the country. And in a major turn of events, as the investigation over the leaked phone call is still underway, Paetongtarn Shinawatra has returned to the interim government as cultural minister, as the cabinet reshuffle was undertaken by the new Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai. Spiking Economic Crisis amidst Political Backlash The political uproar ignited by a leaked phone call is coupled with economic crisis. Thailand’s economy is already shrinking and people are extremely unhappy. Adding to this burden, the Cambodian administration has threatened to stop fuel, gas and agricultural imports from Thailand, leaving the Thai economy and people’s life at crossroads. Cambodia and Thailand has a bilateral trade of $10.4 billion and these economic restrictions from Cambodia can push the Thai economy into further deterioration. The political instability, ambition for power, chances of military takeover of the administration accompanied by economic downturn is ultimately pushing the lives of common people of Thailand under doldrums who are agitating and protesting on the streets against the misdeeds of the government.",

            "description": "Tech Mahindra's Impressive Profit Surge: A Testament to Strategic Execution Tech Mahindra, a major player in the IT services industry, posted a remarkable 33.9% rise in consolidated net profit for the April-June quarter, totaling Rs 1,140.6 crore. This is in comparison to Rs 851.5 crore recorded in the same period last year, as per the firm's latest regulatory filing.The company's revenue from operations slightly increased by 2.65% to Rs 13,351.2 crore for the first quarter of FY26, compared to the previous year's Rs 13,005.5 crore. However, on a sequential basis, there was a slight decline in both net profit, down by 2.2%, and revenue, marginally decreasing by 0.2%.CEO and Managing Director Mohit Joshi highlighted a 44% increase in deal wins over the last twelve months, attributing this success to disciplined execution and a focused strategy. The company's workforce grew by 897 employees year-on-year, with a current headcount of 148,517. Tech Mahindra's shares rose 1.94% on the BSE following the announcement of these financial results post market hours.",

            "description": "NATO's Sanction Threats: A Pressure Tactic Against Russia? On Wednesday, veteran journalist and foreign affairs analyst Waiel Awwad sharply criticized NATO's recent warning of imposing sanctions on nations like India, China, and Brazil over their trade relations with Russia. He described the move as part of a broader United States' strategy aimed at applying pressure on Moscow.Awwad pointed out that the US's attempt to isolate Russia via diplomatic and economic means has largely failed over the past three years, compelling them to resort to such high-pressure tactics. “This rhetoric from the US and NATO comes against a backdrop of their awareness that the conflict with Russia is far from over. They are escalating by sending more advanced weapons targeting Moscow,” Awwad remarked, in response to the latest comments by NATO.NATO's chief, Mark Rutte, alongside US Senators, warned India, China, and Brazil of potential '100 per cent secondary sanctions' should they persist with their economic engagements with Russia in the absence of peace initiatives for Ukraine. This stance is consistent with former President Trump's recent threats of severe tariffs against countries trading with Russia, raising the stakes in international diplomacy.",

            "description": "India’s Economy Projected To Grow 6.5% In FY26 On Sound Fiscal Management: EAC-PM New Delhi, July 16 (KNN) The Indian economy is projected to grow at 6.5 percent in the current financial year (2025–26), buoyed by strong domestic fundamentals despite mounting global uncertainties, according to S. Mahendra Dev, Chairman, Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM).Speaking on Tuesday, Dev noted that the country’s economic resilience stems from a favourable policy environment, declining inflation, and robust domestic demand. \"There are significant global headwinds, including geopolitical tensions and trade policy uncertainties. However, the Indian economy remains resilient and continues to be the fastest-growing among large economies,\" he said.Dev attributed the expected growth to a combination of low inflation—supported by a favourable monsoon—and a benign interest rate environment, driven by three consecutive rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). He added that high-frequency indicators for the first two months of FY26 reflect continued strength in domestic economic activity.“A 6.5 percent GDP growth for FY26 is feasible despite global uncertainties. India’s medium-term growth outlook remains strong, underpinned by sound fiscal management,” he stated.According to Dev, rising public capital expenditure is expected to further stimulate economic activity, complemented by healthy expansion in private consumption. These factors, he said, will play a crucial role in sustaining momentum through the year.However, global financial institutions have taken a more cautious view. Both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank recently revised India’s growth projections downward to 6.2 percent and 6.3 percent, respectively, citing increased global risks and trade-related disruptions.The Indian economy is estimated to have grown at 6.5 percent in FY2024–25, maintaining its position as one of the world’s fastest-growing major economies.(KNN Bureau)",

            "description": "YouTube rolled out its new feature, Hype, in India as part of a broader rollout across 20 global markets, including Indonesia, Mexico, and several EU countries. Initially piloted in late 2024 in Brazil, Taiwan, and Turkey, Hype is aimed at helping emerging creators gain visibility through a community-driven approach to content discovery.Designed for creators with fewer than 500,000 subscribers, the feature allows viewers to “hype” newly uploaded long-form videos within seven days of their release. Each user is given three free hypes per week to endorse content they find engaging. These hype points contribute to a weekly leaderboard that highlights the top 100 hyped videos in each country, and may also result in special badges or increased visibility within the platform.To further support smaller channels, creators with lower subscriber counts receive bonus hype points, helping them compete more effectively with more established content creators. While hype points do not affect YouTube’s search rankings or recommendation algorithms, they offer a new way for viewers to influence discovery based on direct feedback and engagement.The feature also includes a monetary incentive for creators whose videos gain momentum via Hype, offering an additional reward for content that resonates with audiences. YouTube has signaled plans to evolve the feature over time, with potential additions such as paid hype options and enhanced tools for mobile creator management.",

            "description": "The recently concluded Lord’s Test between India and England was a high-octane thriller. England edged past India by 22 runs to take a 2-1 lead in the five-match series.The action now shifts to Old Trafford, Manchester, where the fourth Test is scheduled to begin on July 23. Ahead of the match, England has announced their squad, and a major headline is the return of Liam Dawson after nearly eight years.Who is Liam Dawson?Shoaib Bashir, who sealed England’s win at Lord’s by taking Mohammed Siraj’s wicket, has been ruled out of the remainder of IND vs ENG Test series due to injury.In his place, England has drafted in left-arm spinner Liam Dawson for the crucial fourth Test. Dawson is making his comeback into the Test squad after a long gap of eight years.Test Debut Against IndiaLiam Dawson made his Test debut back in 2016, and interestingly, it was against India in Chennai.His last Test appearance came in July 2017. Since then, he has been out of the national red-ball setup. Now, as he returns to the England squad, all eyes will be on whether he gets a place in the final playing XI and what impact he can make.Liam Dawson’s International RecordLiam Dawson hasn’t played many Tests for England. So far, he has featured in just 3 Test matches, claiming 7 wickets. In ODIs, he has taken 5 wickets from 6 matches. In the shortest format (T20Is), he has played 14 T20Is and taken 11 wickets with his left-arm spin.England Squad for 4th Test vs IndiaBen Stokes (captain), Joe Root, Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Jacob Bethell, Harry Brook, Brydon Carse, Zak Crawley, Liam Dawson, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Jamie Overton, Josh Tongue, Chris Woakes.With the series delicately poised, Liam Dawson's return could add an interesting spin dynamic to the contest at Manchester.",

            "description": "The Kawad Yatra, meant to be a spiritual act of devotion and sacrifice, is increasingly drawing criticism for the chaos it brings with it. What should be a peaceful pilgrimage is now frequently marred by violence, traffic disruptions, and public intimidation. Videos from cities like Ghaziabad and Roorkee show so-called kawadiyas vandalizing vehicles, assaulting civilians, and halting emergency services—all while chanting religious slogans.In one shocking incident, a man’s car was damaged after it slightly touched a kawad being carried. Instead of holding the attackers accountable, police seized the victim’s vehicle, raising concerns about selective law enforcement.Common citizens are left frustrated, stuck in hours-long traffic jams with no alternatives, while ambulances and exam candidates struggle to reach their destinations. While genuine kawadiyas embody humility and dedication, a growing number appear more interested in flexing power than practicing faith.And here’s the difficult question: do these spiritual journeys even hold value if they’re soaked in aggression, entitlement, and public suffering? Can one truly earn divine merit while inflicting pain on others?Religious freedom is vital—but when faith becomes a shield for lawlessness, society must ask: where does devotion end and disruption begin?",

            "description": "In an unexpected turn of events, researchers in India have made the discovery that “quantum noise” which was always thought to be detrimental to quantum systems, is potentially beneficial in some situations. This new study could pave the way for more stable and effective quantum technologies in the future. The research was conducted by scientists from the Raman Research Institute (RRI) in Bengaluru. Scientists from the Indian Institute of Science, IISER Kolkata and the University of Calgary have identified this breakthrough. Their work is centred on an odd phenomenon in quantum physics called entanglement. In layman terms entanglement refers to two or more particles getting “entangled” so that the state of one will influence the other, even when they are distant apart. When noise enters a quantum system it disrupts this entanglement. This is known as decoherence and it has been one of the biggest challenges in creating quantum computers and other applications. But the RRI team discovered that one type of entanglement, known as “intraparticle entanglement” is more stable to noise. This type of entanglement occurs within one particle, not between two distinct ones. Read More: Drone-deployed seed balls bring green hope to barren hills of Vindhyas The researchers have found that under special circumstances, noise has the ability to restore lost entanglement or even generate it where there was none. This occurred in a kind of noise called amplitude damping, which is analogous to the way energy seeps from a system. In such scenarios, noise was not only not an issue, but part of the solution. When the same experiments were conducted on systems with two different particles entangled, the noise resulted in damage alone. There was no indication of revival or entanglement generation. This indicates that intraparticle entanglement is more robust and can be more beneficial in building quantum applications. To better understand such effects, the scientists also created a analytical equation that aids in monitoring how entanglement evolves under various levels of disturbance. According to Animesh Sinha Roy, the lead author and post-doctoral researcher at RRI said “To analyse this behaviour, we derive an exact analytical expression for the concurrence (a key measure of entanglement) of an intraparticle entangled state subjected to an amplitude damping channel, which also admits an elegant geometric representation”. Professor Urbasi Sinha, director of the Quantum Information and Computing Lab at RRI, explained “Our study lays down the general framework for decoherence in intraparticle entanglement. As a next step, one should extend this towards specific physical systems to make this even more realistic. We ourselves are working on an experiment using single photons and intraparticle entanglement in certain quantum technology applications such as Quantum Communication and Computing.”. She also added that these findings are not specific to a single kind of system and can be applicable to many platforms like neutrons and trapped ions. There is a study that uses “Global Noise Model,” which treats the particle as whole, rather than other particle considering every part as individually. This technique provides a more realistic representation, since every component of a particle is generally interact in the same surroundings. The scientists mentioned of three types of quantum noise: phase damping, which affects phease relationship in quantum interference. Second is depolarizing noise, which alters the state of the system in random directions. Last one is amplitude damping which represent loss of energy in the system. Findings also reveals that each of these noises stimulates different environmental disturbances. Professor Dipankar Home of Bose Institute, Kolkata finds this exploration as an actual breakthrough in quantum eantanglement field. He also says that “It promises to open up uncharted avenues for user-friendly, commercially viable cutting- edge quantum technological applications in the presence of various models of noise/damping using a novel form of entanglement, viz. the entanglement between different properties of a single particle, called intraparticle entanglement.” These findings made by India-Trento Programme for Advanced Research (ITPAR), which was funded for National Quantum Mission by Department of Science and Technology’s. It appeared in Frontiers in Quantum Science and Technology. To sum it up, what was previously considered a threat to quantum systems is now turning out promising. This surprising turn of events in quantum science demonstrates that the world of particles has more surprises for the Humans and Quantum world. This major finding in quantum technology will supports the National Quantum Mission by enhancing secure defence networks, domestic innovation and worldwide collaborations. This advancement will help India’s Vishwaguru vision.",

            "description": "हममें से ज्यादातर लोग दांतों की सफेदी को ही उनकी सेहत और सफाई का पैमाना मानते हैं। जब कोई मुस्कुराते हुए चमकते सफेद दांत दिखाता है तो हमें लगता है कि उसके दांत बिल्कुल हेल्दी होंगे। लेकिन दांतों का रंग सच में उनकी मजबूती और साफ-सफाई को नहीं दर्शाता है। हल्के पीले दांत भी पूरी तरह स्वस्थ और मजबूत हो सकते हैं। तो चलिए, जरूरत की खबर में आज बात करेंगे कि सफेद और पीले दांतों में क्या फर्क होता है? साथ ही जानेंगे कि- एक्सपर्ट: डॉ. पुनीत आहूजा, डेंटल-ओरल और मैक्सिलोफेशियल सर्जन, श्री बालाजी एक्शन मेडिकल इंस्टीट्यूट, दिल्ली सवाल- दांत पीले या बदरंग क्यों हो जाते हैं? जवाब- हमारे दांतों की सबसे बाहरी परत को इनैमल (Enamel) कहा जाता है। यह बहुत मजबूत होती है, लेकिन इसमें सूक्ष्म छिद्र (microscopic pores) होते हैं। जब हम चाय, कॉफी, कोल्ड ड्रिंक या शुगरी ड्रिंक्स पीते हैं तो इनके रंग और दाग इन छिद्रों में धीरे-धीरे जमा होने लगते हैं। यही कारण है कि समय के साथ दांतों का रंग फीका पड़ने लगता है और वे पीले या बदरंग दिखने लगते हैं। इसके अलावा कुछ अन्य वजहें भी हैं, इसे नीचे दिए ग्राफिक में देखिए- आइए, इन पॉइंट्स को विस्तार से समझते हैं। ठीक से ब्रश न करना अगर आप दिन में दो बार सही तरीके से ब्रश और फ्लॉस नहीं करते हैं तो दांतों पर एक चिपचिपी परत (प्लाक) जम जाती है। समय के साथ यह परत सख्त होकर टार्टर बन जाती है। ये टार्टर खाने के रंग और बैक्टीरिया को पकड़ लेता है, जिससे दांत पीले हो जाते हैं। चाय-कॉफी और शुगरी ड्रिंक्स चाय, कॉफी, कोक, वाइन और कुछ स्पोर्ट्स ड्रिंक्स में आर्टिफिशियल कलर और एसिड होते हैं। ये धीरे-धीरे दांतों की ऊपरी परत में जमा हो जाते हैं और दांतों को पीला कर देते हैं। अगर लंबे समय तक इनका सेवन किया जाए और सफाई सही से न हो तो दाग पक्के हो जाते हैं। धूम्रपान (स्मोकिंग) सिगरेट और तंबाकू में निकोटीन होता है, जो दांतों पर पीले या भूरे दाग छोड़ता है। लंबे समय तक स्मोकिंग करने से ये दाग गहरे होते जाते हैं और दांतों की ऊपरी परत (इनैमल) के अंदर तक पहुंच सकते हैं। उम्र और जेनेटिक्स कारण कई बार दांतों का पीला रंग जेनेटिक होता है। अगर माता-पिता के दांत पीले हैं तो बच्चों के भी हो सकते हैं। इसके अलावा उम्र बढ़ने पर इनैमल घिसता है और नीचे की पीली परत (डेंटिन) ज्यादा दिखने लगती है। कुछ दवाइयों का असर कुछ एंटीबायोटिक दवाएं, जैसे टेट्रासाइक्लिन या ऑक्सिटेट्रासाइक्लिन बच्चों के दांत बनने के समय दी जाएं तो उनका रंग बदल सकता है। दांत ग्रे या पीले दिखाई देने लगते हैं। चोट या एक्सीडेंट अगर दांत या मुंह पर चोट लग जाए तो दांत की सतह टूट सकती है या अंदरूनी हिस्सा डैमेज हो सकता है। इससे दांत का रंग बदल सकता है। सवाल- क्या पीले दांत, सफेद दांतों से ज्यादा हेल्दी होते हैं? जवाब- डॉ. पुनीत आहूजा कहते हैं कि दांतों का रंग देखकर यह नहीं कहा जा सकता कि दांत हेल्दी हैं या नहीं। असली बात ये है कि दांत मजबूत हैं या नहीं और आप मुंह की सफाई यानी ओरल हाइजीन का कितना ध्यान रखते हैं। इसे इन पॉइंटर्स से समझिए- दांतों की मजबूती अगर दांतों की ऊपर की परत यानी इनैमल सुरक्षित है तो हल्के पीले दांत भी उतने ही मजबूत होते हैं जितने सफेद दांत। कई बार बहुत सफेद दांत सिर्फ दिखने में अच्छे होते हैं, लेकिन उनके अंदर कैविटी या बैक्टीरिया हो सकते हैं। सेंसिटिविटी (झनझनाहट) हल्के पीले दांतों में आमतौर पर सेंसिटिविटी कम होती है। जब तक इनैमल घिसा न हो। दूसरी ओर बहुत सफेद दांत (खासतौर पर ब्लीच किए गए) का इनैमल पतला हो सकता है, जिससे ठंडा-गर्म लगना शुरू हो सकता है। दाग-धब्बों की संभावना अगर ओरल हाइजीन ठीक नहीं है तो पीले दांतों पर दाग जल्दी दिखने लगते हैं। हालांकि सफेद दांतों पर भी दाग हो सकते हैं, लेकिन शुरू में वे कम नजर आते हैं और बाद में साफ दिखने लगते हैं। ट्रीटमेंट से सफेदी ज्यादातर लोगों के दांत नेचुरली हल्के पीले होते हैं और यह सामान्य है। बहुत सफेद दांत आमतौर पर ब्लीचिंग या अन्य ट्रीटमेंट से सफेद किए जाते हैं, जो नेचुरल नहीं होते हैं। यह समय के साथ इनैमल को नुकसान पहुंचा सकते हैं। सवाल- क्या होम रेमेडीज से दांत सफेद करना सही है? जवाब- घरेलू नुस्खे जैसे बेकिंग सोडा, नींबू का रस या एक्टिवेटेड चारकोल से दांतों को साफ और सफेद दिखाने की कोशिश की जाती है, लेकिन यह तरीका हमेशा सुरक्षित नहीं होता है। इन चीजों में तेज एसिड या खुरदुरे कण होते हैं, जो दांतों की ऊपरी परत यानी इनैमल को धीरे-धीरे घिस सकते हैं। ऐसे उपाय करते समय डॉक्टर से सलाह लेना जरूरी है। सवाल- क्या दांतों को हमेशा सफेद बनाए रखना संभव है? जवाब- दांतों को बिल्कुल सफेद बनाए रखना नेचुरल रूप से हमेशा संभव नहीं होता है क्योंकि समय के साथ हमारा खान-पान, उम्र, लाइफस्टाइल और आदतें दांतों के रंग को प्रभावित करती हैं। हालांकि अगर आप रोजाना अच्छी ओरल हाइजीन अपनाते हैं, जैसे सही तरीके से ब्रश करना, फ्लॉस करना, शुगरी ड्रिंक्स से बचना और समय-समय पर डेंटल क्लीनिंग करवाते हैं तो दांतों को लंबे समय तक साफ, स्वस्थ और चमकदार जरूर बनाए रखा जा सकता है। सवाल- क्या दांत जितने ज्यादा सफेद होंगे, उतने ही साफ और हेल्दी माने जाएंगे? जवाब- यह एक आम मिथक है। सफेद दांत हमेशा हेल्दी या साफ हों, यह जरूरी नहीं है। असल में, दांतों की स्वस्थता का पैमाना उनकी सफाई, मजबूती और मुंह की कुल हाइजीन से तय होता है, न कि सिर्फ रंग से। इसलिए जरूरी है कि हम केवल सफेदी के पीछे न भागें, बल्कि दांतों की सही देखभाल और सफाई पर ध्यान दें। सवाल- क्या रेगुलर डेंटल क्लीनिंग जरूरी है? जवाब- हां, रेगुलर डेंटल क्लीनिंग यानी समय-समय पर प्रोफेशनल तरीके से दांतों की सफाई कराना बहुत जरूरी है। इससे कई फायदे हैं। जैसेकि- आमतौर पर हर 6 महीने में एक बार डेंटल क्लीनिंग कराना काफी होता है। अगर मसूड़ों की समस्या है या ओरल हेल्थ पहले से कमजोर है तो डॉक्टर की सलाह अनुसार यह अंतराल कम भी किया जा सकता है। .............. ये खबर भी पढ़ें... 2050 तक आधी आबादी होगी मायोपिया से प्रभावित:चश्मा टेस्ट के बाद रोजाना इस्तेमाल जरूरी, नहीं तो बढ़ सकती हैं आंखों की समस्याएं नेशनल लाइब्रेरी ऑफ मेडिसिन में पब्लिश एक रिव्यू रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, पिछले 4 दशकों में 5 से 15 वर्ष के बच्चों में मायोपिया के मामले 7.5% तक बढ़ गए हैं। वहीं पिछले एक दशक में गांवों में भी मायोपिया के मामलों में 4.6% से 6.8% तक इजाफा हुआ है। पूरी खबर पढ़िए...",

            "description": "सवाल: मैं अपने मौजूदा पार्टनर से मिलने से पहले एक एब्यूजिव रिलेशनशिप में थी। मेरा करेंट पार्टनर काइंड और समझदार है, लेकिन मुझे उस पर पूरी तरह भरोसा करना मुश्किल लगता है। मुझे अक्सर एंग्जाइटी होती है और जब वह करीब आने की कोशिश करता है, तो मैं उसे दूर धकेल देती हूं। उसमें खूब पेशेंस है, लेकिन मेरे इस बर्ताव से उस पर असर पड़ रहा है। मैं अपने अतीत से उबरने के लिए क्या करूं और उसके साथ एक हेल्दी रिश्ता कैसे बनाऊं? क्या मुझे प्रोफेशनल मदद लेनी चाहिए या यह समय के साथ ठीक हो जाएगा? एक्सपर्ट: अदिति सक्सेना, काउंसलिंग साइकोलॉजिस्ट, भोपाल जवाब: एक अपमानजनक रिश्ते से गुजरना किसी के लिए भी आसान नहीं होता है। चाहे वह इमोशनल शोषण हो, मानसिक तनाव हो या शारीरिक नुकसान, ऐसे अनुभव हमारे मन पर गहरे निशान छोड़ जाते हैं। ये निशान इतने गहरे हो सकते हैं कि जब हम एक नए रिश्ते में कदम रखते हैं, तो अपने दयालु और प्यार करने वाले पार्टनर पर भरोसा करना भी मुश्किल लगने लगता है। अगर आप भी इस स्थिति से गुजर रहे हैं, जहां आपका दिल चाहता है कि आप अपने नए पार्टनर के साथ खुश रहें, लेकिन आपका दिमाग बार-बार आपको डर और शक की ओर धकेलता है, तो यह लेख आपके लिए है। हम यहां उन चुनौतियों की बात करेंगे जो आपके सामने आती हैं, उनके पीछे के कारण समझेंगे, और फिर कुछ ऐसे आसान और कारगर तरीके जानेंगे जिनसे आप अपने नए रिश्ते को मजबूत बना सकते हैं। साथ ही, हम यह भी देखेंगे कि आपके पार्टनर इसमें कैसे आपकी मदद कर सकते हैं, और समय व प्रोफेशनल मदद का क्या रोल हो सकता है। तो चलिए, इस सफर को साथ में शुरू करते हैं। क्या-क्या परेशान करता है? जब आप एक अपमानजनक रिश्ते से निकलकर नए रिश्ते में आते हैं, तो कुछ परेशानियां बार-बार आपके सामने आती हैं। ये वो मुश्किलें हैं जो आपके रिश्ते को प्रभावित करती हैं। आइए इन्हें समझते हैं: विश्वास की कमी: मान लीजिए आप अपने पार्टनर के साथ बाहर घूमने गए हैं। वे आपके लिए कुछ खास करते हैं, लेकिन आपके मन में एक सवाल उठता है- क्या ये सच में मेरे लिए हैं या सिर्फ दिखावा है? आप उनके फोन को चेक करना चाहते हैं, हालांकि आपको पता है कि यह गलत है। ऐसा इसलिए होता है क्योंकि आपके पिछले रिश्ते में आपका भरोसा बार-बार टूटा है। चिंता और डर: अगर आपका पार्टनर आपको मैसेज करने में थोड़ी देर कर दे, तो आपका दिल तेजी से धड़कने लगता है। क्या वे मुझसे नाराज हैं? क्या वे मुझसे कुछ छिपा रहे हैं? यह डर आपके पिछले अनुभवों का नतीजा है, जो आपको हर पल सतर्क रखता है। भावनात्मक दूरी बनाना: अपने दिल को फिर से टूटने से बचाने के लिए, आप अपने पार्टनर से थोड़ा दूर रहने की कोशिश करते हैं। आप उन्हें अपने मन की बात नहीं बताते, और धीरे-धीरे रिश्ते में एक खालीपन सा आ जाता है। पार्टनर पर प्रभाव: आपकी ये परेशानियां सिर्फ आपको ही नहीं, आपके पार्टनर को भी प्रभावित करती हैं। वे कोशिश करते हैं कि आपको अच्छा लगे, लेकिन जब आप उनसे दूरी बनाते हैं, तो उन्हें लगता है कि शायद वे कुछ गलत कर रहे हैं। इससे वे उदास या असहाय महसूस कर सकते हैं। इन चुनौतियों के पीछे क्या कारण हैं? इन परेशानियों को समझने के लिए हमें उनके कारणों पर नज़र डालनी होगी। ये वो वजहें हैं जो आपके मन को प्रभावित करती हैं: इसे थोड़ा विस्तार से समझिए- इस मुश्किल से कैसे निकलें? अब सवाल यह है कि इन चुनौतियों से निपटने और अपने नए रिश्ते को मज़बूत करने के लिए आप क्या कर सकते हैं। यहां कुछ आसान और कारगर उपाय हैं: अपने अतीत को समझें और स्वीकार करें सबसे पहले यह मान लें कि आपके पिछले अनुभवों ने आपको प्रभावित किया है। यह सोचें कि आपकी चिंता या शक आपके पार्टनर की गलती नहीं, बल्कि आपके अतीत का असर है। अपनी भावनाओं को एक डायरी में लिखें या किसी करीबी से साझा करें- यह आपके मन को हल्का करेगा। खुलकर बात करें अपने पार्टनर से अपनी भावनाओं के बारे में ईमानदारी से बात करें। उन्हें बताएं, \"मुझे तुम पर भरोसा करने में दिक्कत हो रही है, लेकिन यह मेरे पुराने रिश्ते की वजह से है।\" इससे वे आपकी मदद कर सकेंगे। प्रोफेशनल मदद लें अगर आपको लगता है कि अतीत का बोझ बहुत भारी है, तो किसी काउंसलर या थेरेपिस्ट से मिलें। वे आपको आपके डर और नकारात्मक सोच से बाहर आकर विश्वास बनाने में मदद करेंगे। अपना ख्याल रखें खुद को समय दें और ऐसी चीज़ें करें जो आपको खुशी दें। योग करें, सुबह की सैर पर जाएं, या अपनी पसंद का कोई शौक अपनाएं, like पेंटिंग या गाना। यह आपके मन को शांति देगा। धीरे-धीरे विश्वास बनाएं छोटे-छोटे कदम उठाएं। जैसे, अपने पार्टनर को कोई छोटी ज़िम्मेदारी दें और देखें कि वे उसे कैसे निभाते हैं। हर सकारात्मक अनुभव आपके भरोसे को बढ़ाएगा। सीमाएं तय करें अपने पार्टनर के साथ यह साफ करें कि आपको कितना समय और कितनी आज़ादी चाहिए। इससे आप दोनों के बीच गलतफहमियां कम होंगी। अपनों से मदद लें दोस्तों और परिवार से बात करें। वे आपको हिम्मत देंगे और आपको अकेलापन महसूस नहीं होने देंगे। धैर्य रखें यह प्रक्रिया धीमी है। अपने और अपने पार्टनर के साथ नरमी बरतें। हर छोटी जीत को सेलिब्रेट करें। आपके पार्टनर के लिए सुझाव आपके पार्टनर का साथ इस सफर को आसान बना सकता है। यहां उनके लिए कुछ सुझाव हैं- धैर्य रखें: उन्हें आपकी स्थिति समझने और जल्दबाज़ी न करने के लिए कहें। खुलकर बात करें: वे भी अपनी भावनाएं साझा करें ताकि आप दोनों करीब आएं। सहानुभूति दिखाएं: उन्हें बताएं कि आपकी दूरी उनकी गलती नहीं, बल्कि आपके अतीत का नतीजा है। सीमाओं का सम्मान करें: अगर आपको अकेले समय चाहिए, तो वे उसे समझें। क्या समय सब ठीक कर देगा? कहते हैं कि समय हर घाव भर देता है, लेकिन सच यह है कि सिर्फ समय काफी नहीं है। आपको अपने दर्द पर काम करना होगा। अगर आप इसे अनदेखा करेंगे, तो यह आपके रिश्ते को और कमज़ोर कर सकता है। प्रोफेशनल मदद जैसे कि थेरेपी, आपके लिए एक बेहतर रास्ता हो सकती है, खासकर अगर आपकी चिंता आपकी रोजमर्रा की जिंदगी को प्रभावित कर रही है। भरोसा ही है इस समस्या का हल अपमानजनक रिश्ते से निकलकर एक नए रिश्ते में विश्वास बनाना आसान नहीं है, लेकिन यह नामुमकिन भी नहीं। अपने अतीत को स्वीकार करें, अपने पार्टनर के साथ खुलकर बात करें, और ज़रूरत पड़ने पर मदद लें। छोटे-छोटे कदम उठाएं और धैर्य रखें। आप अकेले नहीं हैं, हजारों लोग इस राह से गुजर चुके हैं और एक खुशहाल रिश्ता बना चुके हैं। आप भी यह कर सकते हैं। बस खुद पर भरोसा करें और आगे बढ़ें। .......................... ये खबर भी पढ़ें रिलेशनशिप एडवाइज- तलाक के बाद की दूसरी शादी:मेरी बेटी नए पापा को एक्सेप्ट नहीं कर रही, उसे लगता है उसकी मां का प्यार बंट गया मैं तलाकशुदा महिला हूं और मेरी एक 10 साल की बेटी है। मैंने एक विडोवर से दूसरी शादी की है, जिसकी एक 12 साल की बेटी है। पूरी खबर पढ़िए...",

            "description": "NEW YORK, July 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Paranovus Entertainment Technology Limited (\"PAVS\" or the \"Company\"), (NASDAQ: PAVS) announced today that on July 11, 2025, the Company received a notification letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\"Nasdaq\"), notifying the Company that the minimum bid price per share for its Class A ordinary shares has been below $1.00 for a period of 30 consecutive business days and the Company therefore no longer meets the minimum bid price requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The notification received has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company's Class A ordinary shares on Nasdaq. Under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company has until January 7, 2026 to regain compliance. If at any time during such 180-day period the closing bid price of the Company's Class A ordinary shares is at least $1 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company written confirmation of compliance. If the Company does not regain compliance during such 180-day period, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar days, provided that the Company meets the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for Nasdaq except for Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), and provide a written notice of its intention to cure this deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.

During the Chengdu Games, the Indian contingent secured 26 medals, inclusive of 11 golds, 5 silvers, and 10 bronzes, with shooting contributing significantly to this haul.Noteworthy performances in the past included Olympian Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar and Manu Bhaker, the latter winning two golds in pistol events, later claiming two bronzes at the Paris 2024 Olympics. Athletes Jyothi Yarraji, Amlan Borgohain, and Priyanka Goswami also earned podium finishes. The upcoming event will be the 32nd edition since its inception in 1959.

            "description": "NATO Chief Warns of 'Massive' Sanctions Impact on Brazil, China, and India NATO's Secretary General, Mark Rutte, has issued a stark warning to countries such as Brazil, China, and India, highlighting the potential severe impacts of secondary sanctions should they persist in trading with Russia. Rutte's remarks came during a meeting with U.S. senators, following President Donald Trump's announcement of new weaponry for Ukraine and the threat of 100% secondary tariffs on Russian export purchasers, unless a peace agreement is reached within 50 days.Rutte stressed the potential repercussions on these nations, urging leaders in Beijing, Delhi, and Brazil to advocate for serious peace negotiations with Vladimir Putin. He emphasized that failure to promote dialogue could result in substantial setbacks for these countries. Senator Thom Tillis voiced concerns over the 50-day window, fearing it could provide Putin with an opportunity to strengthen his position.Rutte assured that Europe would mobilize funds to optimize Ukraine's standing in peace talks, underlining an agreement with the U.S. to significantly enhance military support, encompassing a range of weaponry funded by European powers. Although discussions on long-range missiles for Ukraine were acknowledged, Rutte stated that detailed negotiations on the matter are currently underway with military leaders.",
