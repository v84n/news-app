This system is designed to engage aerial targets effectively, both day and night, even in adverse weather conditions such as snow-bound environments.The Ministry of Defence has issued a request for proposal (RFP) seeking prospective bidders to supply 48 launchers, 48 night-vision sights, 85 missiles, and a missile test station. The procurement is part of a strategic move to bolster the Army's air defence capabilities against evolving dynamic air threats.Developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation, the VSHORADS is a man-portable system praised for its 'fire-and-forget' missile technology. The system is capable of defending against fighter jets, helicopters, and unmanned aerial systems across various terrains and will be employed by all three branches of India's armed forces.",

            "description": "Water Wars: Haryana Urges Central Intervention in Dispute with Punjab In the wake of mounting tensions over water distribution between neighboring states, Jannayak Janta Party leader Dushyant Chautala has appealed to the central government for immediate intervention. Chautala condemned the Aam Aadmi Party and highlighted the need for Haryana, Delhi, and Rajasthan to receive their rightful share of water, even suggesting the use of force.This appeal follows an all-party meeting convened in Haryana by the BJP, in response to Punjab's refusal to adhere to the Bhakra Beas Management Board's decision on water allocation. Haryana Chief Minister expressed concerns over the state's ongoing water shortage, reiterating the need for fair resource distribution.Meanwhile, Punjab's Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann raised alarms over diminishing water levels in key dams, stressing the state's own water needs. As tensions simmer, the call for federal oversight grows louder, with regional leaders seeking to prevent a full-blown crisis amid critical water shortages.",

            "description": "Vikrant Massey was part of a panel discussion titled The Changing Face of Indian Cinema at the ongoing WAVES 2025 in Mumbai. Sharing the stage with filmmaker Om Raut, actress Sonali Kulkarni, and actor Ravi Mohan, Massey offered a grounded perspective on why small-town narratives are resonating more deeply with audiences today.Reflecting on the shift in storytelling patterns within Hindi cinema, the 12th Fail actor pointed to changing audience preferences, exposure to global content, and a move toward realism. “Cinema, a few years ago, was an experience for a layman—to see machismo, larger than life, one man beating up 20 people. We all have grown up watching it, and we still watch it. But a large chunk also goes to our exposure to international cinema and a certain sense of pragmatism even in storytelling,” he said.Massey credited earlier films like Dum Laga Ke Haisha for paving the way, while acknowledging how the so-called \"alternative\" genre has now entered the mainstream. “Today, what I feel is that what was alternative 15 years ago is mainstream today. I can never imagine a film like 12th Fail or Trapped to be commercially successful back then,” he noted. He also highlighted how relatability plays a key role in the rise of such narratives. “Most of the people I have met here have told me ‘Thank you for 12th Fail, this is our story.’ When they see themselves or someone alike on the screens, there is a sense of hope which is still there within us,” he said.In addition to audience-driven change, Massey brought attention to the practical aspects that encourage filmmakers to explore small-town settings—particularly government incentives. “Why are most of us also moving to smaller towns? Because of subsidies. Very straightforward answer this is! Jo state sarkaar hame achchi subsidy deti hai, achcha infrastructure deti hai, hum wahin jaate hai,” he said candidly. The actor cited Uttar Pradesh as an example, where the film policy provides a single-window clearance system and strong logistical support.He added that cities like Delhi are now developing their own ecosystems: “Earlier, there was only one industry in Mumbai; now even Delhi has an industry. You will get all the equipment in Delhi, and overnight it will reach Lucknow.”Quoting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent statement at the summit, Massey concluded, “In a nation of more than 140 crore, we have more than 100 crore stories, and we are tapping into those smaller stories, bigger stories, larger-than-life stories. I think it is just the beginning.”Vikrant Massey is now gearing up for the release of Aankhon Ki Gustaakhiyan, which also marks the debut of Shanaya Kapoor. The film is slated to release in July this year.Also Read: WAVES 2025: Kareena Kapoor Khan recalls Steven Spielberg recognising her from 3 Idiots; says, “I didn’t need to act in an English film for him to see me”",

            "description": "The anthology Bombay Talkies completed 12 years today. The film had four short segments out of which one was Murabba. Directed by Anurag Kashyap, it starred Viineet Kumar Siingh in the lead. On the film’s anniversary, Viineet spoke about the film in an interview with us.Bombay Talkies has completed 12 years. Your performance in the omnibus is still talked aboutI am so happy. I did not even realize that 12 years have gone by. It was a very good experience in Bombay Talkies. The story in which I worked was Murabba. The character's name was Vijay and it was amazing. It was about the task given by the father of that character played by Sudhir Pandeyji, ‘You go and feed the murabba to the superstar of the century Amitabh Bachchan sir and then my health will be fine.’ That boy, my character Vijay comes to Mumbai from Prayagraj to feed the jam to Amitabh Bachchan sir with his own hands.Your character had a brilliant graphYes, in that whole process the way a character evolves in Mumbai, from coming to feeding the jam and back... In the journey between leaving and reaching his father back home, he understands life. He understands that he was living in some other world and perhaps this was his father's intention that his son should evolve and understand life on his own. So, in the whole effort and struggle to feed Bachchan saab a murabba, he saw and lived so much of life that it would be useful to him throughout his life.Did the story help you evolve?That story was very useful to me as an actor. I had a lot of fun and I consider myself fortunate because I was part of film for the celebration and tribute to 100 years of Indian cinema. Bombay Talkies was made for this purpose and four very good directors directed four stories - Karan Johar sir, Zoya Akhtar, Dibakar Banerjee and Anurag Kashyap sir. I got to work with Anurag sir. This character Vijay was something new for me, sir. It was something that I am not in my personal life and most of the scenes were improvised, meaning they were hardly written in four pages.You shot most of the film outside Mr Bachchan’s bungalowIt literally used to happen impromptu. The guards outside Bachchan sahab's bungalow were also not informed and I was left alone to behave like a fan. A random talk would start, then the guards would be told about the purpose of my visit. It seemed as if someone has actually come who insists on feeding Bachchan sir jam, so that entire scene is the first take, so even the guards did not know that this was going to happen and it was planned, so that the scene kept getting improvised and all the scenes that came after that also kept being improvised, talking to a random taxi driver, talking to a random stranger, asking him, so there are a lot of moments like this in that film.So much improvisation must have helped you evolve as an actorIt helped me a lot as an actor; now improvising feels like it makes the process of acting beautiful, that some things are planned and some things are unplanned. And when both are mixed it becomes beautiful. So, it was a very good experience and that story is liked and even now people send its clips, some of its clips keep going viral every now and then, so I am so happy today. 12 years have been completed and thank you so much sir. Thank you, it is a big thing that you remembered me for this thing. It is a big thing for an artist to do some work and if the connoisseurs remember that character, then it is a happiness which lasts a lifetime. The money that we earn while working gets spent but this appreciation keeps increasing with time, so that's the beauty of good work. Thank you so much sir. I want to share one more thing.Tell me?Working with Amitabh Bachchan sir, sharing the screen is in itself every actor's dream. Before that, before Bombay Talkies, in 2005, I had done Viruddh as an assistant director, so I was on the floor with Bachchan sir for about 55-60 days. I was an AD, so after some eight years, when the time for screen sharing with him came, it seemed that whatever happens in life, it's happening for a reason. One more thing was special for me: Rajeev Ravi who is the cameraman, this was my second film with Rajiv sir. Before this, I had worked with Rajiv sir in Gangs of Wasseypur. Murabba was shot in a different way, mostly as I told you, things were being improvised, random things were happening. I did not even know from where the camera would capture me. All this was a lot of new learning experience for me.Also Read: Dibakar Banerjee on 12 Years of Bombay Talkies, “It all started with my hero Satyajit Ray”",

            "description": "Indian cricket superstar Virat Kohli found himself at the centre of a social media storm after his verified Instagram account liked a photo posted by a fan page dedicated to Bollywood actress Avneet Kaur. The incident, which sparked widespread speculation and a flurry of memes, prompted the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) batter to issue a public clarification on May 2, 2025, stating that the interaction was unintentional and caused by an algorithmic error.On May 2, Kohli took to his Instagram Stories to address the speculation, stating, “I’d like to clarify that while clearing my feed, it appears the algorithm may have mistakenly registered an interaction. There was absolutely no intent behind it. I request that no unnecessary assumptions be made. Thank you for your understanding.” The like was subsequently removed from the post, but the clarification did little to quell the online frenzy, with fans continuing to share humorous takes and some questioning the plausibility of an algorithmic error.The controversy began on April 30, when a fan page for Avneet Kaur shared a series of bold photos of the 24-year-old actress from her recent trip to Goa, featuring her in a stylish green crop top and printed wrap skirt. On May 1, eagle-eyed netizens noticed Kohli’s username among the post’s likes, leading to a cascade of reactions online. The timing of the incident, coinciding with Kohli’s heartfelt birthday post for his wife, actress Anushka Sharma, fuelled further chatter, with some users questioning the cricketer’s intentions and others flooding comment sections with humorous remarks.Screenshots of the like circulated rapidly, with fans tagging Anushka Sharma and even Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, demanding accountability for what some believed was a technical glitch.Also Read: Neeti Mohan shares unseen photo of Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli from their daughter Vamika’s birthday celebration",

This decision, announced by the commerce ministry, follows a tragic terror attack in Pahalgam, which claimed 26 lives.According to the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2023, the new provision restricts the import or transit of all goods originating in or exported from Pakistan until further notice. The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) formalized this order, emphasizing its importance for public policy.Any exceptions to this import prohibition will require explicit approval from the Government of India. This move is seen as a strategic measure to strengthen national security and public safety.",

            "description": "धार्मिक शहर उज्जैन में मोबाइल पर रील देखने और गेम खेलने की लत छुड़ाने के लिए अब लोग भगवान का सहारा ले रहे हैं। चिंतामन मंदिर परिसर में स्थित विघ्नहर्ता गणेश मंदिर में बच्चों की बुरी लत छुड़ाने के लिए पुजारी संकल्प दिला रहे हैं। खास बात ये है कि कई बच्चे यहां संकल्प लेने के बाद मोबाइल पर गेम खेलने की आदत छोड़ भी चुके हैं। दरअसल नशे की तरह ही बच्चे मोबाइल के आदी होते जा रहे हैं। इसका बुरा असर उनके व्यवहार पर पड़ने लगा है। माता-पिता ने जरा सी जिद करने पर जिस मोबाइल को खिलौना समझ बच्चों को थमाया था, अब वही उनके लिए तनाव का कारण बनता जा रहा है। मोबाइल की लत से दूर रखने के लिए तरह-तरह के जतन के बीच भगवान का सहारा लिया जा रहा है, अभिभावक बच्चों को मोबाइल से दूर रखने के लिए पढ़ाई और खेल में व्यस्त कर रहे हैं, तो इस बीच धार्मिक उपाय भी कर रहे हैं। उज्जैन शहर से करीब 6 किमी दूर प्रसिद्ध चिंतामन गणेश मंदिर परिसर में लक्ष्मण बावड़ी के पास स्थित विघ्नहर्ता गणेश मंदिर में बच्चे मोबाइल की लत छुड़ाने के लिए संकल्प ले रहे हैं। मंदिर के पुजारी ईश्वर शर्मा ने बताया कि कई लोग इस मंदिर में अपनी मुराद लेकर आते थे, लेकिन कुछ समय से लोगों ने मुझे कहा कि हमारे बच्चे को मोबाइल की लत है और वो छोड़ता नहीं है। जिसके बाद हमने बच्चों को संकल्प दिलाना शुरू किया, कुछ दिन बाद उन्हीं अभिभावकों ने फोन पर मुझे बताया कि आपके संकल्प ने मोबाइल पर गेम खेलना और दिन भर मोबाइल पर रील देखना बंद कर दिया है। अब तक करीब 200 बच्चों का मोबाइल संकल्प से छुड़वा चुका हूं। ऐसे होता है संकल्प- पुजारी ईश्वर शर्मा ने बताया कि हम तो सिर्फ मंदिर में लक्ष्मण बावड़ी के समीप विराजमान विघ्नहर्ता गणेश के सामने बच्चों को बैठाते हैं, उसी से संकल्प दोहराते हैं फिर ये मूषक के कान में अच्छे से पढ़ाई की बात बुलवाते हैं। कई माता-पिता बच्चों को तीन से पांच बुधवार लेकर आ रहे हैं और संकल्प करवा रहे हैं। यहां आने पर बच्चों में ये विकृति में कमी आ रही है, जो अभिभावक बच्चों को लेकर मंदिर आते हैं उनको भगवान गणेश के सामने खड़े कर संकल्प दिलवाते हैं जो इस प्रकार है। \"हे विघ्नहर्ता हमको अच्छी बुद्धि देना, विद्या देना, मैं मम्मी-पापा दादा-दादी और नाना-नानी सहित सभी बड़ों की बात मानूंगा। मैं जिद नहीं करूंगा, मैं मोबाइल पर गेम नहीं खेलूंगा, बड़ों की बात सुनूंगा।\" ऐसे शुरू हुआ सिलसिला- पुजारी ईश्वर शर्मा बताते हैं कि देशभर से श्रद्धालु मंदिर में भगवान गणेश का आशीर्वाद लेने के लिए आते हैं। यहां आने वाले कुछ लोग दर्शन करते समय अपने बच्चों को मोबाइल से दूर रखने की बात करते थे। , तभी से लगा की मंदिर में बच्चों को मोबाइल से दूर रहने का संकल्प दिलवाना चाहिए और करीब एक साल से ये परम्परा चल निकली और जिन लोगों को पता चलता है और जो बच्चों को मोबाइल से दूर रखना चाहते हैं वो अभिभावक अपने बच्चों को लेकर मंदिर पहुंच जाते हैं। मनोचिकित्सक बोले धार्मिक भावना जोड़कर लत छुड़ाने का अच्छा प्रयास- मनोचिकित्सक डॉ. पराग ढोबले ने बताया कि 20 प्रतिशत अभिभावक बच्चों की मोबाइल संबंधी लत को लेकर आ रहे हैं। अधिकांश बच्चे मोबाइल पर ऑनलाइन गेम के ज्यादा एडिक्ट हो रहे हैं। मनोवैज्ञानिक तरीके से ऐसे बच्चों का इलाज कर रहे हैं। धार्मिक स्तर पर भी बच्चों को मोबाइल से दूर रखने के लिए उन्हें मोटिवेट किया जा रहा है, यह भी एक अच्छा प्रयास है। देशभर से श्रद्धालु मंदिर में दर्शन के लिए आते हैं- मंदिर की मान्यता है कि त्रेता युग में 14 वर्ष के वनवास के दौरान भगवान राम, लक्ष्मण और सीता ने उज्जैन के शिप्रा नदी किनारे राम घाट पर दशरथ जी का पिंडदान किया और उसके बाद दक्षिण दिशा में चलते हुए मंदिर के पास आकर वटवृक्ष के नीचे आराम कर ही रहे थे कि सीता मैया को पूजन करने का मन किया इस दौरान वटवृक्ष के पास भगवान चिंतामन, इच्छामन और सिद्धिविनायक की मूर्ति देख उन्होंने प्रथम पूजन इस मंदिर में किया था। हालांकि इस दौरान जलाभिषेक करने के लिए जब उन्हें जल नहीं मिला तो लक्ष्मण जी अपने बाण से मंदिर के सामने ही बाणगंगा के रूप में जल को पाताल से जमीन पर ले आए थे तभी से यहां पर बावड़ी का नाम बाणगंगा और लक्ष्मण बावड़ी रखा गया था। इसी बावड़ी के पास विराजित है विघ्नहर्ता गणेश मंदिर।",

            "description": "Trump Administration Settles Lawsuit Over Maine Nutrition Funds The administration of President Donald Trump has reached a settlement to unfreeze funds previously halted for a Maine child nutrition program. The funds were initially suspended due to President Trump's disagreement with Maine over policies concerning transgender athletes.Maine's Attorney General Aaron Frey announced the cessation of the lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture following the administration's decision. Frey emphasized the significance of ensuring federal compliance with the law, which ultimately led to a resolution favoring continued support for feeding children and vulnerable adults in the state.The conflict originated from the federal government's decision to freeze significant financial allocations for administrative functions in Maine's schools. This action prompted the state to sue, arguing the funds were essential for its nutrition programs. The lawsuit noted the critical expectation of approximately $3 million typically awarded in July for summer meal programs. Governor Janet Mills commended the legal team's efforts in securing the necessary funds to uphold vital nutrition services for over 172,000 children.",

            "description": "Danone's Bold Move: Ditching Artificial Dyes for Healthier U.S. Yogurt Danone, the yogurt giant, is planning to eliminate artificial dyes from its U.S. products amidst growing health concerns and regulatory scrutiny. Shane Grant, CEO of Danone's Americas business, confirmed the initiative, aligning it with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s agenda to boost national health.Only 2% of Danone's U.S. portfolio contains artificial dyes, with popular items like Yo Crunch vanilla yogurt with M&Ms using them. The move is seen as a proactive step given increasing consumer awareness and related policy changes across American states.The Consumer Brands Association has also highlighted the industry's shift towards dye-free products. Despite reports of Kennedy's understanding with food manufacturers, no formal agreement exists. States like Arizona and West Virginia have already banned such dyes in school food, underscoring the trend's momentum.",

            "description": "Trump's Executive Order Targets NPR and PBS Funding President Donald Trump's administration has issued an executive order to eliminate federal funding for NPR and PBS, two key U.S. broadcasters. The decision is part of the administration's strategy to sanction organizations it perceives as political adversaries.The order demands that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting halt direct funding to PBS and NPR. While NPR plans to contest the order legally, PBS is exploring possible courses of action. Currently, a significant portion of their funding originates from non-federal sources, with Congress having already allocated $535 million to CPB for fiscal year 2025.The White House justifies the funding cuts by accusing NPR and PBS of using taxpayer money to promote indoctrination disguised as news. However, CPB's Patricia Harrison argues that Congress, not the president, has the authority over this funding. Civil liberties advocates express worries about potential impacts on free speech, as NPR and PBS explore alternatives to maintain their programming integrity.",

            "description": "Kuwait is cracking down on cryptocurrency miners throughout the country, as reported by Reuters. Officials have blamed the practice for blackouts and for causing stress on its power grid. The country started this crackdown just before the onset of summer, which experts say could reach scorching temperatures of 125 degrees Fahrenheit.Kuwait’s Ministry of Interior said in a statement that it has been conducting a \"wide-ranging\" security operation that targets homes suspected of being used for cryptocurrency mining. The government agency went on to say that crypto mining is illegal, as the country’s Capital Markets Authority banned the practice in 2023. Crypto trading was also banned at that time.The crackdown has been targeting homes in the Al-Wafrah region of Kuwait, which is located in the southern part of the country. The region’s electricity ministry has said that around 100 homes were being used for mining operations, often consuming up to 20 times the normal power levels. To that end, energy consumption in the area dropped by 55 percent following the operation, according to a government statement.It’s no secret that cryptocurrency mining gobbles up vast amounts of computing power and, as such, electricity. Kuwait isn’t the only country to regulate or outright ban the practice. Russia has banned crypto mining in several regions throughout the country. Kosovo outlawed the practice back in 2022 and Angola did the same in 2024. European countries like Iceland and Norway have strictly regulated the industry due to energy shortages.As for Kuwait, researchers at the University of Cambridge estimated that the country was responsible for just 0.05 percent of the world's bitcoin mining in 2022. Alex de Vries-Gao, founder of a research project that tracks crypto energy use, told Reuters that \"it only takes a very small share of the total bitcoin mining network to have a significant impact on the relatively small total electricity consumption of Kuwait.\"Recent data indicates that crypto mining accounts for almost 2.5 percent of the total energy consumption of the US. That’s approximately half of the energy used by the entire commercial sector of the US economy. But hey, at least we get some fake coins we can’t buy anything with for our trouble.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/kuwait-cracks-down-on-crypto-miners-to-cut-down-on-electricity-usage-161200772.html?src=rss",

            "description": "Supreme Court to Review Controversial UP Conversion Law The Supreme Court has decided to review a plea challenging the constitutionality of the 2024 amendments to Uttar Pradesh's law on unlawful religious conversion. Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justices Sanjay Kumar and K V Viswanathan noted arguments by senior lawyer S Muralidhar, who described sections of the Act as 'vague and overly broad', and claimed they violate free speech and religious propagation rights.The plea, submitted by Roop Rekha Verma among others, argues that the law's ambiguous wording violates Articles 14, 19, 21, and 25 of the Constitution by enabling arbitrary enforcement and lacking clear standards. The presumption of malintent behind conversions and a lack of procedural safeguards are central to the concerns raised.Challengers also argue the amendment expands who can file complaints without adequate procedural safeguards, disproportionately affects individuals practicing their faith, and risks wrongful prosecution. The Court will hear these arguments alongside other similar petitions on May 13, scrutinizing the law's alignment with constitutional rights.",

            "description": "SEBI ने ओला इलेक्ट्रिक के खिलाफ इनसाइडर ट्रेडिंग के आरोपों की जांच शुरू की है। एनडीटीवी की रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, ओला इलेक्ट्रिक ने अक्टूबर-दिसंबर 2024 के बीच इनसाइडर ट्रेडिंग और रिलेटेड पार्टी डील्स में नियमों का उलंघन किया है। यह मामला तब सामने आया, जब पहले ही ओला पर फरवरी 2025 की सेल्स रिपोर्ट में गड़बड़ी के आरोप लग चुके हैं। दरअसल, फरवरी 2025 में कंपनी ने दावा किया था कि उसने 25,000 इलेक्ट्रिक व्हीकल बेचे और इलेक्ट्रिक टू-व्हीलर में 28% मार्केट शेयर हासिल किया था। लेकिन सरकारी वेबसाइट VAHAN पर दर्ज आकड़ों के अनुसार फरवरी में ओला के सिर्फ 8,600 वाहनों का ही रजिस्ट्रेशन हुआ था। इस बड़े अंतर पर सेबी जांच कर रही है। केंद्रीय परिवहन मंत्रालय भी नोटिस दे चुका इससे पहले 25 अप्रैल को केंद्रीय परिवहन मंत्रालय ने ओला को शो-कॉज नोटिस जारी किया था। मंत्रालय ने 7 दिन के अंदर कई अहम सवालों के जवाब मांगे थे। नोटिस में ओला से इन सवालों के जवाब मांगे 22 अप्रैल को महाराष्ट्र में 121 स्टोर्स पर कार्रवाई के निर्देश दिए थे तीन दिन पहले महाराष्ट्र में ट्रांसपोर्ट विभाग ने ओला के 121 स्टोर्स बंद करने के निर्देश दिए हैं। ट्रांसपोर्ट विभाग ने ओला के 146 स्टोर्स की जांच की थी, इनमें 121 से ज्यादा स्टोर्स बिना ट्रेड सर्टिफिकेट के चल रहे थे। दरअसल, पिछले महीने RTO ने महाराष्ट्र में ओला के कई स्टोर्स पर छापेमारी की थी। स्टोर्स पर ट्रेड सर्टिफिकेट नहीं होने के चलते 192 व्हीकल्स को जब्त कर कारण बताओ नोटिस दिए गए थे। ओला इलेक्ट्रिक का शेयर 1 साल में 46% गिरा शुक्रवार को ओला इलेक्ट्रिक शेयर 0.33% की गिरवट के साथ 48.53 रुपए पर बंद हुआ। एक महीने में ओला का शेयर 10% से ज्यादा गिरा है। वहीं पिछले एक साल में शेयर 45% से ज्यादा टूटा है। ओला का मार्केट कैपिटल 22.14 हजार करोड़ रुपए है। ओला के स्टोर पर 4 बार हुई रेड ओला के स्टोर्स पर देशभर में RTO कार्रवाई हुई थी। अब तक महाराष्ट्र और मध्यप्रदेश के 32 स्टोर्स पर रेड पड़ चुकी है। इसके अलावा राजस्थान में कुछ स्टोर्स पर भी कार्रवाई की गई है। इसमें 50 से ज्यादा इलेक्ट्रिक गाड़ियों को जब्त किया जा चुका है। दूसरी कंपनियों की शिकायत के बाद कार्रवाई गुरुग्राम की प्रताप सिंह एंड एसोसिएट्स कंपनी ने ओला इलेक्ट्रिक और कुछ अन्य कंपनियों के खिलाफ ट्रेड सर्टिफिकेट नहीं होने की शिकायत दर्ज कराई थी। शिकायत के बाद महाराष्ट्र के ट्रांसपोर्ट अधिकारियों ने कार्रवाई की । ओला इलेक्ट्रिक ने कहा- रेड की कार्रवाई गलत और पक्षपातपूर्ण रेड की कार्रवाई पर ओला इलेक्ट्रिक के प्रवक्ता ने बताया था कि कोई वाहन जब्त नहीं किया गया है। इससे पहले ओला ने जांच को गलत और पक्षपातपूर्ण बताया था। प्रवक्ता ने कहा था कई राज्यों में ओला के डिस्ट्रीब्यूशन सेंटर्स और गोदामों में अनरजिस्टर्ड व्हीकल्स की इन्वेंट्री है। ये मोटर व्हीकल एक्ट के दिशानिर्देशों का पूरी तरह से पालन करती है और जरूरी मंजूरियां मौजूद हैं। कंपनी ने स्टोर्स पर रेड को लेकर कोई जानकारी नहीं दी थी।",
