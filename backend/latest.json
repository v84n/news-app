The visa was issued on Friday after an interview at Mumbai's US Consulate office.Informing about the development, the student's father Tanhaji Shinde said that they had received a call from the embassy and were granted visa within half an hour. He also mentioned that the family received help from both the central and the Maharashtra government.\"I received a phone call from her roommate on February 16. However, she didn't tell me about the accident. Later, she informed Neelam's uncle about it. She is still in coma, however, her condition has improved slightly. We came here (to the embassy). They took our interview and granted Visa in half an hour. We will leave (for the US) tomorrow. Both the Cental and Maharashtra government helped us a lot. The media also helped us. My daughter is in coma, we can't do much. I just wish she gets well soon,\" he said.Nilam Shinde was taking a walk at Sacramento when a speeding vehicle hit her. She sufferedsevere fractures to her legs, skull, left arm, and a brain injury which left her in coma.Meanwhile, Shinde's uncle Sanjay Kadam praised the Centre and state government for their help and requested that the process of getting an emergency visa be eased.\"Neelam sustained major injuries, and she is in coma. The central govt and state govt did a good job, and we have now got the Visa. Earlier, we were trying to book a slot (at the US Consulate) via agents, but then this news reached the govt through the media, and the govt helped us... We request the Indian govt that the process of Emergency Visa should be eased,\" he said.The Indian consulate in San Francisco had expressed solidarity with Shinde's family and assured all support to them.

During the interactive chat, she also addressed questions about artificial intelligence and social media. Preity Zinta Responds to Question on Defamation Case Against Rahul Gandhi At the start of the session, Preity tweeted, \"Suddenly, today seems like the perfect day for #Pzchat! Any advice for the chat, or should we keep it simple? Let me know, guys, because I have an hour to chat.\" During the AMA, a fan asked, \"Are you planning to file a defamation case against Rahul Gandhi?\" Preity responded, \"I don't think it's okay to insult someone like that because he is not responsible for someone else's actions. I believe in addressing issues directly, not fighting someone else’s battle. Also, I have no problem with Rahul Gandhi, so let him live in peace, and I will do the same (smiling face emoji).\" I don’t think it’s fair to vilify anyone like that, as he is not responsible for someone else’s actions. I believe in handling problems or issues directly & not through proxy battles. I also have no problem with Rahul Gandhi, so let him live in peace & I will live in peace too 😀 https://t.co/LAAGOdOJri — Preity G Zinta (@realpreityzinta) February 27, 2025 Preity Zinta on Entering Politics Another fan asked, \"You are truly a soldier, Preity! Salute to you! Are you planning to join politics?\" She replied, \"No! No politics for me. Over the years, many parties have offered me tickets and Rajya Sabha seats, but I have politely declined because it's not what I want. Calling me a soldier isn’t entirely wrong, though, as I am a soldier's daughter and an army officer's sister (smiling face emoji).\" Preity Zinta on National Identity Emphasizing her patriotism, Preity said, \"We children of soldiers are not North Indian or South Indian or Himachali or Bengali. We are simply Indian. Patriotism and national pride are in our blood.

            "description": "Bhopal: A session court in Bhopal on Thursday sentenced a woman to life imprisonment for killing her one-month-old daughter and also imposed a fine of Rs 1,000. The court of Additional Sessions Judge Atul Saxena found Sarita Mewada guilty under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 302. Judge Saxena awarded life imprisonment to the convict and imposed the fine under the said Section. The incident occurred in September 2020. The convict, Sarita, wished for a boy but she gave birth to a girl. Whenever she saw her daughter, she used to curse herself. Following which, one day taking advantage of a situation of being alone in the home, she killed her daughter by putting her into a water tank. Public Prosecutor Sudhavijay Singh Bhadoria said, \"The case is related to the incident that took place on September 16, 2020. Sarita said that she laid her daughter on a cot but she was not on the cot and there was none other than her in the house. Later, when searched, the little one was found dead in a water tank kept inside the house.\" \"Sarita's husband, Sachin Mewada said in his statement that when he questioned his wife Sarita, she started crying and said that she had put her one-month-old daughter in the water tank and closed the lid. Sarita had thought that she would have a boy, but when she gave birth to a girl, she did not love the girl. Whenever she saw her, she started cursing herself. Therefore, taking the opportunity that there was no one in the house, she put the daughter in the water tank and closed the lid and did not tell this to anyone due to fear,\" Bhadoria said. Following the incident, an FIR was registered under IPC Section 302 at Khajuri Sadak police station in the state capital and began the investigation. Based on the evidence collected from the incident site and after complete investigation, a charge sheet was presented before the Court, she said. During the trial of the case, the court agreed with the evidence, arguments and precedents presented by the prosecution. The court convicted the accused and sentenced her to life imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1,000 under Section 302 of the IPC, the Public Prosecutor said. Additionally, while passing judgment on the case, the court made a special comment that daughters are a powerful signature of civilisation, culture, and nation-building in the present era.",

            "description": "रीवा के शिल्पी प्लाजा स्थित लोकायुक्त कार्यालय में गुरुवार देर रात भीषण आग लग गई। बताया जा रहा है कि आग शॉर्ट सर्किट के कारण लगी। सूचना मिलते ही फायर ब्रिगेड की दो गाड़ियां मौके पर पहुंचीं और करीब 4 घंटे की मशक्कत के बाद आग पर काबू पाया गया। लोकायुक्त कार्यालय के गार्ड शिवलाल साकेत ने बताया कि सबसे पहले उन्हें कांच टूटने की आवाज सुनाई दी, जिससे उन्हें लगा कि कोई चोर घुस आया है। जब उन्होंने मौके पर जाकर देखा तो आग लग चुकी थी, जो धीरे-धीरे भयानक रूप धारण कर गई। आग की लपटों के कारण कार्यालय में रखा पुराना रिकॉर्ड जलकर खाक हो गया। सूत्र- 50 से अधिक पुराने दस्तावेज जलेघटना रात करीब 10:30 बजे हुई। आग लगने के बाद धुएं का गुबार पूरे भवन में फैल गया। घटना की जानकारी मिलते ही लोकायुक्त कार्यालय के वरिष्ठ अधिकारी और सिविल लाइन थाने की पुलिस मौके पर पहुंच गई। लोकायुक्त कार्यालय के अधिकारियों ने आग में जले दस्तावेजों को अनुपयोगी बताया है, लेकिन सूत्रों के मुताबिक 50 से अधिक पुराने कागजात जलकर नष्ट हो गए हैं। सिविल लाइन थाना प्रभारी कमलेश साहू के मुताबिक आग लगने की सही वजह का अब तक खुलासा नहीं हो सका है, लेकिन प्राथमिक जांच में शॉर्ट सर्किट को कारण बताया जा रहा है। हालांकि, इस मामले में लोकायुक्त के अधिकारी फिलहाल कोई आधिकारिक बयान देने से बच रहे हैं। अगर समय पर आग पर काबू नहीं पाया जाता तो आसपास के शासकीय कार्यालयों की महत्वपूर्ण फाइलें भी इसकी चपेट में आ सकती थीं। मामले की जांच जारी है। सिविल लाइन थाना प्रभारी कमलेश साहू के मुताबिक आग लगने की वजह का खुलासा नहीं हो पाया है। लेकिन प्रथम दृष्टया शार्ट शर्किट की वजह से आग लगना बताया जा रहा है। बाकी सब कुछ जांच के बाद ही स्पष्ट हो पाएगा।",

            "description": "मध्यप्रदेश में मार्च के पहले सप्ताह में बादल छाने और हल्की बारिश होने के आसार हैं। 2 मार्च से पश्चिम-उत्तर भारत में वेस्टर्न डिस्टरबेंस (पश्चिमी विक्षोभ) एक्टिव हो रहा है। जिसका असर प्रदेश में भी देखने को मिल सकता है। खासकर 4 मार्च से इंदौर, ग्वालियर, चंबल हिस्से में कहीं-कहीं मौसम बदला हुआ रह सकता है। इससे पहले दिन-रात के तापमान में 2 से 4 डिग्री तक की बढ़ोतरी देखने को मिलेगी। फरवरी में मौसम का मिला-जुला असर रहा। शुरुआती दिनों में ही तेज ठंड पड़ी, लेकिन दूसरे सप्ताह से ठंड जैसी गायब सी हो गई। भोपाल, इंदौर, ग्वालियर, उज्जैन, जबलपुर समेत कई शहरों में रात का पारा 10 डिग्री से अधिक ही रहा। वहीं, दिन में 34 डिग्री तक पहुंच चुका है। फरवरी के आखिरी दिन शुक्रवार को भी मौसम का मिजाज ऐसा ही बना रहेगा, लेकिन मार्च के पहले सप्ताह में मौसम में फिर से बदलाव देखने को मिल सकता है। दो दिन बाद असरउत्तर-पश्चिमी भारत में सक्रिय होने वाले वेस्टर्न डिस्टरबेंस का असर प्रदेश में 2 दिन बाद यानी, 4 मार्च से देखने को मिल सकता है। इसके अलावा एक साइक्लोनिक सकुर्लेशन सिस्टम भी एक्टिव है। इस कारण भोपाल समेत कई शहरों में बादल छाए रहे। रात के पारे में बढ़ोतरी, 10 डिग्री के पार पहुंचाप्रदेश में पांच दिन तक तेज ठंड पड़ी। इस वजह से पचमढ़ी समेत कई शहरों में पारा 10 डिग्री से नीचे ही रहा, लेकिन बुधवार-गुरुवार की रात में पारे में फिर से बढ़ोतरी होने लगी। कई शहरों में पारा 2 से 4 डिग्री तक बढ़ गया। पचमढ़ी में 10.2 डिग्री, कल्याणपुर में 10.3 डिग्री, शाजापुर के गिरवर में 11.2 डिग्री, उमरिया में 11.3 डिग्री, अशोकनगर के आंवरी में 11.6 डिग्री और मंडला में पारा 12 डिग्री तक दर्ज किया गया। इधर, गुरुवार को दिन के तापमान में भी बढ़ोतरी देखने को मिली है। अगले 2 दिन ऐसा मौसम28 फरवरी: तापमान में बढ़ोतरी देखने को मिलेगी। कहीं-कहीं बादल भी छा सकते हैं।1 मार्च: भोपाल, इंदौर समेत कई शहर में दिन का पारा 2 से 3 डिग्री तक बढ़ सकता है। फरवरी में 10 साल का ट्रेंड... तीनों मौसम का असरप्रदेश में पिछले 10 साल के आंकड़ों पर नजर डालें, तो फरवरी महीने में रातें ठंडी और दिन गर्म रहते हैं। बारिश का ट्रेंड भी है। इस बार भी ऐसा ही मौसम रहा है। भोपाल, इंदौर और उज्जैन में दिन का अधिकतम तापमान 30 डिग्री के पार पहुंच गया, जबकि रात में 10 से 17 डिग्री के बीच रहा। मौसम विभाग के अनुसार, फरवरी में सबसे ज्यादा ग्वालियर ठिठुरता है। पिछले साल यहां न्यूनतम तापमान 6.1 डिग्री तक पहुंचा था, लेकिन इससे पहले 5 डिग्री के नीचे ही रहा है। जबलपुर में दिन में गर्मी और रात में ठंड रहती है। फरवरी के 27 दिनों में मौसम में उतार-चढ़ाव की स्थिति देखने को मिली। इस बार 2 महीने कड़ाके की ठंडअब बात ठंड की ओवरऑल स्थिति की। इस बार शुरुआती दो महीने यानी, नवंबर और दिसंबर में कड़ाके की ठंड पड़ी। ठंड ने कई रिकॉर्ड तोड़ दिए। नवंबर की बात करें तो भोपाल में 36 साल का रिकॉर्ड टूटा। इंदौर, उज्जैन, जबलपुर और ग्वालियर में भी पारा सामान्य से 7 डिग्री तक नीचे रहा। वहीं, दिसंबर में भी ठंड ने रिकॉर्ड तोड़ा। स्थिति यह रही कि पूरे प्रदेश में जनवरी से भी ठंडा दिसंबर रहा। भोपाल समेत कई शहरों में ठंड ने रिकॉर्ड तोड़ दिए। 9 दिन शीतलहर चली। भोपाल में दिसंबर की सर्दी ने 58 साल का रिकॉर्ड तोड़ दिया। भोपाल, इंदौर, ग्वालियर समेत कई जिलों में स्कूलों की टाइमिंग बदल दी गई है, जबकि भोपाल के वन विहार नेशनल पार्क में जानवरों को सर्दी से बचाने के लिए हीटर लगाए गए। भगवान को भी ठंड से बचाने के लिए जतन किए गए। अब बात जनवरी की। शुरुआत 10 से 15 दिन तक कड़ाके की ठंड का दौर रहा, लेकिन फिर तेवर ठंडे हो गए। ठंड के दो दौर आए, जबकि तीन बार मावठा गिरा। मौसम वैज्ञानिक डॉ. सिंह ने बताया, जनवरी में ठंड का असर जरूर रहा, लेकिन पिछले 10 साल के ट्रेंड के अनुसार तेज सर्दी नहीं पड़ी। पश्चिमी विक्षोभ की स्ट्रॉन्ग एक्टिविटी नहीं होने से तेज बारिश का दौर नहीं रहा। न ही ओले गिरे, जबकि जनवरी में ओला-बारिश का दौर भी रहता है। फरवरी में ओले नहीं गिरे। कुछ ही जिलों में हल्की बारिश दर्ज की गई। MP के 5 बड़े शहरों में फरवरी में ऐसा रहा है सर्दी का ट्रेंड... भोपाल में रातें ठंडी रहती है, दिन गर्मराजधानी भोपाल में रातें ठंडी रहती हैं, जबकि दिन गर्म। वर्ष 2015 से 2024 के बीच 4 साल दिन का अधिकतम तापमान 35 डिग्री के पार पहुंच गया। रात में 7 साल पारा 10 डिग्री से कम दर्ज किया गया। इस महीने बारिश होने का भी ट्रेंड है। हालांकि, 10 साल में सिर्फ 3 बार ही पानी गिरा है। रिकॉर्ड की बात करें तो 11 फरवरी 1950 को रात का पारा 1.7 डिग्री रहा था, जो ओवरऑल रिकॉर्ड है। 22 फरवरी 2006 को अधिकतम तापमान 37.6 डिग्री रहा था। साल 1986 को एक महीने में 2 इंच से ज्यादा पानी गिरा था। इस बार बारिश नहीं हुई। इंदौर में गर्मी का असर रहाफरवरी के महीने में

किया गया था। यहां रात में पारा 10 डिग्री के नीचे रहता है। हालांकि, पिछले साल यह 12 डिग्री रहा था। यहां 1 फरवरी 1929 को रात का पारा रिकॉर्ड 2.8 डिग्री पहुंच चुका है। दिन में 37.9 डिग्री रहा था, जो 22 फरवरी 2006 को दर्ज हुआ था। इंदौर में साल 2001 में पूरे महीने करीब दो इंच बारिश भी हो चुकी है। ग्वालियर में रातें ठंडी रहीग्वालियर में तेज ठंड का ट्रेंड रहता है। इसकी वजह यहां सीधे उत्तरी हवाएं आना है। वर्ष 2018 में 1.9 डिग्री, 2019 में 2.4 डिग्री, 2022 में 2.9 डिग्री और 2023 में पारा 2.3 डिग्री तक पहुंच चुका है। 10 साल में एक बार भी पारा 7 डिग्री से ज्यादा नहीं रहा। इस बार भी फरवरी में ऐसा ही मौसम

            "description": "जवाहर कला केंद्र की पाक्षिक नाट्य योजना के तहत गुरुवार को नाटक ‘कोर्ट मार्शल’ का सफल मंचन हुआ। स्वदेश दीपक द्वारा लिखित इस नाटक का निर्देशन अखिलेश नारायण ने किया है। नाटक की कहानी सामाजिक कानूनों और नियमों पर आधारित है। यह दर्शाता है कि समाज कानून और नियमों के ढांचे पर टिका है लेकिन जब यह ढांचा किसी वर्ग विशेष के साथ भेदभाव करता है तो असंतोष जन्म लेता है। नाटकी की शुरुआत मंच पर उपस्थित करनल सूरज सिंह के संवाद के साथ होती है। वह इस बात पर विचार करता है कि मेरे पिता राजस्थान के एक रियासत के राजा थे लेकिन आज मैं क्या हूं? नाटक में सेना के जवान रामचंदर के संघर्ष को दर्शाया है जो अपने सीनियर अधिकारी द्वारा जातिगत अपमान और शोषण का शिकार होता है। जब सहनशक्ति की सीमा समाप्त होती है तो विरोध के अन्य रास्ते बंद पाकर वह हिंसा का सहारा लेता है।नाटक में प्रभावशाली संवाद से दर्शकों तक बात पहुंचाने का प्रयास किया गया है जिसमें, ‘गाली का जवाब गोली से नहीं दिया जा सकता’ जैसे संवादो का उपयोग किया गया है। नाटक इस ज्वलंत प्रश्न को उठाता है कि क्या जातिगत भेदभाव और सामाजिक अन्याय से मुक्त होना संभव है? क्या एक संस्थागत ढांचा भी इससे अछूता रह सकता है? ‘कोर्ट मार्शल’ केवल सेना तक सीमित नहीं है बल्कि यह पूरे समाज के लिए एक आईना है जो हमें आत्ममंथन करने पर मजबूर करता है। जब तक समाज केवल बाहरी विकास पर ध्यान देगा और आंतरिक रूप से भेदभाव से ग्रस्त रहेगा तब तक ऐसी घटनाएं सामने आती रहेंगी। यह नाटक हमें सोचने पर मजबूर करता है कि विरोध के स्वर को कुचलने की बजाय क्या हम समाधान की दिशा में आगे बढ़ सकते हैं?इसी कड़ी में शुक्रवार को मंच पर जयवंत दलवी की ओर से लिखित और निशा वर्मा की ओर से निर्देशित नाटक ‘पुरुष’ खेला जाएगा जिसका नाट्य रुपांतरण सुधाकर करकरे ने किया है।",

            "description": "Harry Brook failed to step up for England as he was dismissed for 25 off 21 balls by Mohammad Nabi, caught off his bowling. Former India captain turned cricket commentator Sunil Gavaskar took a brutal dig at Harry Brook following his dismissal in England’s eight-wicket win against Afghanistan in the Champions Trophy 2025 Group B match at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. England’s Champions Trophy campaign came to an end after their shocking defeat at the hands of Afghanistan. The match against Afghanistan was crucial for England in order to stay alive in the tournament after losing their opening encounter against Australia. In a massive 326-run chase against Afghanistan, England fell a mere 9 runs short of the target despite fighting 120 off 111 balls by Joe Root and Jamie Overton’s valiant innings of 32 off 28 balls. Harry Brook failed to step up for England as he was dismissed for 25 off 21 balls by Mohammad Nabi, caught off his bowling. Brook’s dismissal prompted brutal dig by Sunil Gavaskar with a reference to England batter’s smog remark. Speaking on Ten Sports show ‘The Dressing Room’, Gavaskar hilariously questioned floodlights condition in Lahore after Brook’s dismissal, recalling his past remark about visibility in Kolkata due to smog “\"I just saw Harry Brook's dismissal. Are the lights in Lahore ok or not? Because when he played in Kolkata, he said that he couldn't see the ball properly because of smog. That's why I'm asking. I hope the Lahore lights are fine? Because the catching practice he gave to get out... I don't know.” the former India captain said. After England’s defeat in the first T20I against India, Harry Brook remarked that lack of visibility due to smog in Kolkata was the reason for the struggle against spin bowling. This statement by England vice-captain was heavily trolled by Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri on the air during the second T20I between India and England in Chennai, with the former cheekily asking ‘is there any smog?’ following Brook’s dismissal. Apart from Brook, Ben Duckett too became a centre of troll after England’s shocking exit from the Champions Trophy 2025 after defeat against Afghanistan. When England were at the risk of getting whitewashed by India in ODI series after going down 0-2, Duckett stated that he did not mind losing to hosts of the series as long as they can ‘beat India in the final’ of the Champions Trophy 2025. Since England could not qualify for the semifinal, Ben Duckett’s comment went viral on social media, with many trolling him for overconfidence, as England could not even make it past the group stage of the marquee event, let alone the final. After winning the T20 World Cup 2022, England did not win a single ICC title. In the ODI World Cup 2023, The Three Lions suffered an early exit from the tournament as the defending champions, finishing seventh in the league stage. In the T20 World Cup 2024, England failed to defend their triumph as they lost to eventual champions India in the semifinal. The latest being their shocking exit from the Champions Trophy 2025, marking yet another disappointing campaign in the ICC tournament. England were one of the favourites to clinch the Champions Trophy 2025. However, Jos Buttler’s side's early yet shocking exit from the marquee event raised the questions about their decline in the ODI format after Eoin Morgan relinquished his white-ball captaincy duties before retiring from international cricket. England will play their final group stage match against South Africa on March 1.",

French Defence Minister Sébastien Lecornu confirmed ongoing discussions, highlighting a growing competition alongside the United States.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to sign a minerals deal with the US, a move previewed by former President Donald Trump. However, France is also in talks with Ukraine to lessen its dependency on single-source mineral supplies. These resources are essential for various technologies, including lithium for batteries and uranium for nuclear power, which are crucial for France's defence industries.French President Emmanuel Macron has tasked Lecornu with these negotiations. Lecornu clarified that France isn't seeking minerals in exchange for its aid to Ukraine but to secure critical resources for future weapons systems. He described the discussions as preliminary, indicating the start of a developing narrative.",

            "description": "मेरठ में भारतीय किसान यूनियन (पथिक) ने क्रांतिकारी किसान नेता विजय सिंह पथिक की जयंती को किसान अधिकार दिवस के रूप में मनाने की मांग की है। यूनियन के राष्ट्रीय अध्यक्ष रविन्द्र सेतकुआं के नेतृत्व में किसानों ने कमिश्नरी पार्क में हवन कार्यक्रम का आयोजन किया। किसान नेताओं ने प्रशासनिक अधिकारियों को ज्ञापन सौंपा। उन्होंने गन्ने का मूल्य 450 रुपये प्रति क्विंटल करने की मांग की। उनका कहना है कि गन्ना पेराई सत्र समाप्त होने को है। लेकिन अभी तक गन्ना मूल्य तय नहीं हुआ है। इस कारण किसानों का करोड़ों रुपये का बकाया अटका हुआ है। यूनियन ने किसानों की कई अन्य मांगें भी रखीं। इनमें किसानों का कर्ज माफ करना और बिजली बिल माफी शामिल है। आवारा पशुओं से फसलों की सुरक्षा के लिए ठोस व्यवस्था की मांग की गई। किसान नेताओं ने कहा कि भूमि अधिग्रहण 2013 के कानून के अनुसार ही किया जाए। हाईवे के किनारे सर्विस रोड पर छायादार वृक्ष लगाने की मांग भी की गई। अधिग्रहित भूमि पर स्थापित उद्योगों में स्थानीय किसान-मजदूरों के बच्चों को रोजगार में प्राथमिकता देने की मांग की गई। साथ ही किसानों की आय सुनिश्चित करने पर भी जोर दिया गया। विजय सिंह पथिक एक महान क्रांतिकारी और किसान नेता थे। उन्होंने बिजौलिया किसान आंदोलन का नेतृत्व किया था। उनकी जयंती पर किसान अधिकार दिवस मनाने की मांग का उद्देश्य किसानों के अधिकारों की लड़ाई को मजबूत करना है।",

            "description": "India Sees Strong GST Growth Amidst Inflation Moderation and Credit Slowdown In January 2025, India's gross and net GST collections surged with growth rates of 12.3% and 10.9% respectively, marking a significant increase from the more modest figures of December 2024. According to a monthly review by NCAER, the manufacturing PMI rose to 57.7, indicating expansion in the sector, while the services PMI also remained high at 56.5.NCAER Director General Dr. Poonam Gupta commented that the decrease in headline inflation to 4.3% has provided more policy space. The agriculture sector, showing resilience, benefits inflation control and supports rural economic momentum. Rabi sowing for 2024-25 reached 104% of normal, with rice and pulses slightly exceeding typical sown areas.Despite these gains, bank credit growth was muted at 11.2% in December 2024, a decline from 20.2% the previous year. Credit to NBFCs also decreased substantially. Dr. Gupta pointed out that sluggish credit growth could affect overall economic momentum. The restoration of risk weight for Scheduled Commercial Banks' exposures to NBFCs and heightened FII outflows pose challenges that need addressing to bolster economic confidence and stability.",

The Bosnian state court's decision to sentence Dodik, a Bosnian Serb separatist leader, to a year in jail has led to fears of destabilization in the region.Dodik, known for his alignment with Russia, was convicted for defying an international peace envoy's orders. The sentence includes a mandate for Dodik to vacate his presidential office in Bosnia's Serb-dominated area for six years, prompting him to enact measures to diminish state influence in the region.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stressed Russia's disapproval, hinting at potential negative repercussions across the Balkans. Russian President Putin's established rapport with Dodik highlights the broader international implications of this judicial action.",

            "description": "Rising GST, Resilient Agriculture Buoys India's Economy Amid Decelerating Bank Credit The Indian economy displayed encouraging signs in January 2025, with robust growth in Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections, according to a review by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER). GST collections surged impressively, with gross and net figures increasing by 12.3% and 10.9% respectively, compared to the more modest 7.3% and 3.3% in December 2024.Manufacturing showed notable expansion with the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) reaching 57.7, while services PMI hovered at a healthy 56.5. NCAER Director General Dr. Poonam Gupta highlighted the easing of headline inflation to 4.3%, which has opened up new policy avenues. Dr. Gupta also noted the resilience of the agricultural sector, with Rabi sowing surpassing expectations, which could support inflation control and economic growth in rural regions.However, growth in bank credit decelerated to 11.2% in December 2024, down from 20.2% a year ago. Financial institutions faced slower credit uptake, particularly from Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), which saw a drop from 15% to 6.7%. Dr. Gupta welcomed the restoration of risk weights for bank exposures to NBFCs but warned of the persistent volatility in Foreign Institutional Investment (FII) outflows, suggesting a strategic pivot towards more stable Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for continued economic resilience.",

Although Ankara sees this as a pathway to peace, government officials are wary of Ocalan’s message being broadcast via video, citing security concerns.A press conference is set for Istanbul where the DEM Party will reveal the outcome of their discussions with Ocalan. While hopes are high, the Turkish government's stance remains firm against a video statement from the incarcerated Kurdish leader.",

Weather bureau sources warn of increasing temperatures, which could lead to the fourth consecutive year of declining yields.As the world's second-largest wheat producer, India hopes for a bumper harvest to avoid costly imports. The recent weather forecasts highlight the possibility of authorities having to adjust the 40% import tax to cope with domestic supply shortages.With temperatures expected to rise significantly beyond seasonal averages, especially in wheat-growing regions, analysts fear a substantial hit to wheat and other winter crops like chickpeas and rapeseed. This trend follows February's above-normal heat, which had already affected crop conditions.",

By harnessing cutting-edge satellite imagery, including NASA's Black Marble night-time light data, the report offers a nuanced view of economic activity across the country.The findings reveal significant growth in select tier-2 and tier-3 cities such as Warangal and Varanasi, underscoring the decentralization of India's economic growth. Notably, cities like Thane and Surat have shown linear growth due to strategic state investments, while North Goa has benefited from a tourism-driven economic surge.With a demonstrated 80% correlation with nominal GDP, the City Vitality Index acts as a key tool for assessing economic dynamics. Its granular insights serve as an indispensable resource for identifying emerging growth centers and supporting targeted investment strategies across India's diverse urban landscapes.",

            "description": "Universal Pension Scheme: The government is working on a Universal Pension Scheme, which will allow individuals to make voluntary contributions and receive pension benefits upon retirement. According to several media reports, the Union Ministry of Labour and Employment is currently developing the initiative.India already offers a range of pension schemes catering to different segments of society. How will this new scheme differ from existing ones? What current pension schemes are available? Will it replace the National Pension Scheme (NPS)?What Is The Universal Pension Scheme?The government is developing a Universal Pension Scheme that will be available to all citizens, including those in the unorganised sector, according to Labour Ministry sources cited by NDTV. Currently, individuals in the unorganised sector, such as construction workers, domestic staff, and gig workers, do not have access to major government-backed savings schemes.The new scheme will also be open to salaried employees and self-employed individuals. The goal behind the Universal Pension Scheme is to streamline the country’s pension and savings structure, possibly integrating some existing schemes. It will provide a secure, voluntary savings option for all citizens.The initiative aims to extend social security beyond traditional employment, providing a structured pension system to a broader section of society.A senior government official told The Economic Times that the scheme would be open to all, as it would not be tied to employment. This would allow self-employed individuals and workers in the unorganised sector to contribute and gradually build their pension.The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is overseeing the development of the scheme. Once the framework is finalised, discussions with stakeholders will be held to ensure smooth implementation, the report added.A key difference between the proposed universal pension scheme and existing EPFO schemes is that contributions will be entirely voluntary, with no financial input from the government. The new scheme is expected to incorporate existing pension programmes such as the Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandhan (PM-SYM) and the National Pension Scheme for Traders and Self-Employed (NPS-Traders), which currently offer a monthly pension of Rs 3,000 after retirement. Contributions range from Rs 55 to Rs 200 per month, which are matched by the government.The Atal Pension Yojana, regulated by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), could also be included in this new framework. Additionally, the government is considering using the cess collected under the Building and Other Construction Workers (BoCW) Act to fund pensions for construction sector workers, according to ET.The central government may also encourage states to merge their existing pension schemes into this unified initiative, ensuring a fair allocation of government funds, increasing pension benefits, and preventing overlap in beneficiary coverage.Also Read: Gold Rate Today (February 27): Check Out Gold Prices In Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, More Cities",

Verma emphasized the sanctity of such speeches, condemning the opposition's actions as unprecedented in the last decade.Proceedings reached a boiling point on February 25 as Speaker Vijender Gupta suspended 12 AAP MLAs, including Leader of Opposition Atishi, amid uproar ahead of the CAG report presentation. AAP members had interrupted the LG's speech, leading to their suspension and subsequent protests outside the Assembly.The suspended legislators, holding posters of Babasaheb Ambedkar, chanted slogans against the state government. BJP MP Praveen Khandelwal accused AAP of undermining democratic norms and hinted at imminent revelations of alleged scams committed by AAP over the past 10 years.Commenting on the denial of entry to the AAP MLAs at the Assembly, Khandelwal alleged that the party was uninterested in legislative deliberations. He insisted that their fear of exposure was driving their actions, accusing them of attempting to sow anarchy while forfeiting their right to participate in the Assembly processes.",

Germany's 10-year bond yield, serving as the euro zone benchmark, fell to 2.412% in early trading, marking its lowest point since February 11.In February, bond yields in the euro zone had risen as investors anticipated increased defense spending amidst U.S. President Donald Trump's talks with Russia over the Ukraine conflict. However, yields have fallen due to a dramatic drop in U.S. Treasury yields and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's skepticism about a large defense budget increase.Italy's 10-year bond yield remained stable at 3.492%, while the spread between Italian and German yields was 106 basis points. Following a significant drop in U.S. Treasury yields, the spread between U.S. and European 10-year yields increased, emphasizing the market's focus on muted U.S. economic data and European defense spending strategies.",

            "description": "Tate Brothers Take Flight Amid Legal Turmoil In a surprising development, internet personality Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan have departed Romania for the United States, as reported by news outlet G4media.ro. Sources from the airport confirmed their early Thursday departure on a private flight.The Tates are under investigation in Romania for allegations of human trafficking but are currently subject to judicial control, a condition necessitating regular police check-ins. Despite their travel ban, Romanian prosecutors, earlier this month, reportedly agreed to their request to journey to the U.S.Further complicating the matter, the Financial Times has disclosed that U.S. officials intervened, pressing the Romanian government to ease the travel constraints on Andrew and Tristan Tate, both former kickboxing champions with dual U.S. and British citizenship. The Tates have consistently denied any involvement in criminal activities.",

On February 26, the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) and the West Assam Milk Producers' Cooperative Union Limited (WAMUL) inked an agreement to double the milk processing capacity at Purabi Dairy's Panjabari plant in Guwahati.The Rs 100 crore expansion project will elevate the plant's capacity from 1.5 lakh liters per day (LLPD) to 3 LLPD, ensuring a consistent supply of quality dairy products to meet rising consumer demand. The initiative will also increase fermented milk product production from 20 metric tons per day (MTPD) to 50 MTPD and establish a new ice cream plant with a capacity of 20 TLPD, enhancing the supply chain and offering better returns for dairy farmers.Under the MoU, senior officials including Cooperation Minister Jogen Mohan, Water Resources Minister Pijush Hazarika, and Additional Chief Secretary B Kalyan Chakravarthy were present. In a parallel development, National Cooperative Organics Limited (NCOL) and North East Dairy and Foods Limited (NEDFL) agreed to create an Organic Demo Farm cum Food Innovation Hub. This project aims to train over 1,000 farmers in organic farming, develop market-ready products, and foster commercialization, thereby integrating organic farming with cooperative dairy activities to bolster Assam's rural economy and sustainability.",

            "description": "On the auspicious occasion of Maha Shivratri on Wednesday, Kashi witnessed an overwhelming surge of devotees seeking the blessings of Baba Vishwanath. This year, the city is set to break all records, with an estimated 25 lakh devotees expected to participate. Since midnight, serpentine queues stretching over 3 kilometers have formed outside the temple, as the doors remain open for an uninterrupted 46-hour darshan. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has been closely monitoring the arrangements to ensure a smooth and well-organized celebration. Senior officials have also been actively patrolling the area, ensuring everything runs seamlessly under the CM’s directives. This year's Maha Shivratri in Kashi has become even more special as it coincides with the Mahakumbh’s return flow, leading to an unprecedented surge in devotees. To manage the enormous crowd, the Kashi Vishwanath Temple Trust and district administration, under CM Yogi’s guidance, have implemented strict security measures. The entire temple complex is under high surveillance with police, paramilitary forces, ATS commandos, and STF units deployed to maintain order. Senior officials continue to assess the situation on the ground to ensure devotees' safety and comfort. Adding to the grandeur, Akhadas' grand procession became a major highlight of the festival. Naga Sadhus of the Juna Akhada marched towards Baba Vishwanath’s temple, carrying tridents, swords, and maces, chanting ‘Har Har Mahadev’. The sacred procession was welcomed with floral showers and garlands, with senior officials, including Divisional Commissioner Kaushal Raj Sharma, Police Commissioner Mohit Agarwal, and DM S. Rajalingam, personally honoring the Naga Sadhus at Gate No. 4 of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham. To ensure a smooth darshan experience for every devotee, VIP protocols were suspended, giving equal access to all. The temple doors were opened at 2:15 AM after the Mangala Aarti, with Baba Vishwanath adorned like a divine groom. Meanwhile, thousands of devotees thronged the Ganga ghats, taking a sacred dip on this auspicious day. The extensive arrangements, carried out under CM Yogi’s supervision, have not only enhanced the devotees' experience but also strengthened Kashi’s global spiritual identity. Many devotees praised the Yogi government for making this Maha Shivratri historic and unforgettable. Aerial flower shower graces Kashi after Prayagraj, following CM Yogi’s directive Rose petals showered as Shiva’s city resonates with ‘Har Har Mahadev’ chants This Mahashivratri was truly special in Kashi, the sacred city of Lord Shiva. On Wednesday, the Yogi government elevated the celebrations by orchestrating a grand flower shower from a helicopter, covering Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham and the Ganga Ghats. As rose petals rained from the sky, chants of 'Har Har Mahadev' echoed through the air, filling devotees with divine joy. Following the Mahakumbh, Kashi witnessed a massive influx of devotees eager for Baba Vishwanath's darshan. Upholding its commitment to honoring religious faith, the Yogi government ensured the continuation of this floral tribute even after the Mahakumbh. The festivities saw vibrant processions of various Akharas, with saints, sadhus, and devotees from across the country immersing themselves in devotion. The atmosphere was electric, reaching its peak as petals cascaded over the celebrating crowds.",

            "description": "Delhi Denial: AAP MLAs Blocked from Assembly Amidst Rising Tensions Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs staged a demonstration outside the Delhi Assembly on Thursday, protesting their blocked entry on the third day of the session under the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government. Leader of Opposition Atishi and fellow MLAs were reportedly halted by police at the Speaker's orders, setting the stage for a contentious start to the proceedings.Atishi, speaking to ANI, condemned the actions as undemocratic, asserting that no precedent exists for such a blockade. Despite previous suspensions for chanting 'Jai Bhim,' she pointed out that protests in Parliament continue uninterrupted. She claimed, \"Today, they are not even being allowed to enter the Vidhan Sabha premises,\" after multiple attempts to engage with the Speaker failed.The Assembly Speaker had extended the suspension of 21 AAP MLAs for three days following protests against the alleged removal of photographs of Baba Saheb Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh. Reacting to their conduct, BJP MLA Mohan Singh Bisht criticized the AAP's behavior as inappropriate. Concurrently, BJP MLA Satish Upadhyay highlighted a CAG report's allegations of corruption against AAP, promising discussions on how the party purportedly favored close relatives at a cost to Delhi's revenue.",

            "description": "Posani Krishna Murali was arrested for allegedly making derogatory remarks against Pawan Kalyan. He resisted arrest, citing health issues, but was taken into custody and will face court proceedings Thursday. Telugu actor, screenwriter, and YSR Congress Party leader Posani Krishna Murali was arrested from his Hyderabad residence on Wednesday. The arrest came after he allegedly made derogatory comments and casteist remarks against Andhra Pradesh cabinet minister Pawan Kalyan. Murali resisted his arrest, leading to a heated exchange with the police at his home. In viral videos, Murali can be seen refusing to go with the police, citing health issues. He argued with officials, insisting he was undergoing medical treatment. Despite his resistance, the police handed an arrest warrant to his family and took him into custody. The situation escalated as Murali continued to protest against his arrest. Authorities charged Murali under sections 196, 353(2), and 111, along with section 3(5) of the SC/ST Act. The arrest warrant stated that his offense was non-bailable, and he was forwarded to the Additional Judicial Magistrate of Rajampet. He is set to be produced before the court on Thursday for further proceedings. This is not the first time Murali has faced legal trouble. In November 2024, he was booked for making offensive comments about Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu. His latest arrest has sparked discussions in political and film circles, with supporters and critics reacting strongly to the unfolding events. [WATCH VIRAL VIDEO]",

            "description": "Father of 20-year-old Prakriti Lamsal, a Nepalese student who died by suicide in Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), clings to his faith in justice, hoping that India will not fail his daughter. \"Since the era of Ramayan, both countries have maintained the roti-beti ka rishta,\" Sunil Lamsal told TOI over the phone from Kathmandu on Wednesday. \"I cannot be in Odisha for the entire duration of the probe, but I am confident that the Indian government will do what it needs to,\" he added. The roti-beti ka rishta - a connection of shared livelihoods and cross-border marriages - has long tied Nepal and India. A third-year computer science student at KIIT, Prakriti had left her home in Bhairahawa, just five kilometers from the Indian border, for a future in India. She had promised her family she would return - an engineer with dreams fulfilled. The Lamsals first learned of KIIT through university outreach programs in Kathmandu. It seemed like an ideal place for Prakriti, who joined her cousins Anurodh and Siddhant—one pursuing computer science like her, the other in mechanical engineering. She arrived in India with the hopes of thousands of young students: a degree, a job, a better life for her family—especially for her nine-year-old brother whom she adored. Also read: 'Russia will have to make concessions but Ukraine can forget about joining NATO,' says Donald Trump (WATCH) \"There were two things Prakriti cared about the most: becoming an engineer and looking after her little brother,\" Lamsal recalled, his voice heavy with sorrow. \"She wanted to get him into the best school, to shape his future. She was shy but always willing to help others. A bright career has been cut short. I have lost my daughter—she wanted to set an example for others to follow. Those responsible should not go unpunished.\" Prakriti had the courage to speak up. Twice, she had filed complaints against a fellow student, accusing him of harassment. However, the university responsed with mere counselling session for both students—no official action, no warning to the family. \"A firm action could have saved her,\" Lamsal said, the weight of those words crushing. On February 16, just two hours before suicide, Prakriti had spoken to her mother. Nothing suggested the turmoil she was carrying within. \"There was no indication of the anxiety she was carrying,\" her father said. And then, in the blink of an eye, their world shattered. News of Prakriti’s death triggered protests at campus, with more than 500 students reportedly asked to vacate their hostels in the aftermath. The Nepalese embassy quickly intervened, sending officials to investigate and extend support. \"If it weren’t for them (the students), this may never have come to light,\" Lamsal said, his gratitude tinged with the realization of how easily tragedies can be buried. Nepal’s Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli personally called Prakriti’s family on Tuesday, offering what little could still be given: diplomatic weight, legal backing, and the promise of intervention. \"This news has deeply saddened me. It has brought grief to all of us. We cannot change what has happened. It was an unfortunate event... An investigation is underway,\" he assured. Like Prakriti’s father, he placed his trust in the Indian authorities. \"Many Nepali children are studying in India. We do not want such incidents to recur. Our government must take proactive steps in this matter,\" he said, his words not just of sorrow, but of warning. Oli’s response was firm: \"Nepal is watching this case.\" Another call soon followed. Nepal’s Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba reached out to Odisha Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi, echoing a demand that had now become a rallying cry: \"Impartial investigation. Legal action. Accountability.\" Nepal’s National Human Rights Commission joined the chorus, pressing its Indian counterpart to ensure that Prakriti’s case does not fade. Sunil Lamsal waits. A grieving father, a shattered family. A promise of justice, a history of inaction. \"We are waiting, watching,\" he said. \"Nepal is too.\" Also read: 'Not being racist, but I'm not recommending anyone to go to India': Viral Reddit post on KIIT sparks debate",

            "description": "New Delhi: The Union Cabinet has given its approval to the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, based on recommendations from a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) report presented in Parliament on February 13. Sources indicate that the Cabinet sanctioned the proposed amendments during a meeting held on February 19. The report was introduced in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha during the initial phase of the 2025 Budget Session. However, its presentation triggered protests from the Opposition, resulting in temporary adjournments of proceedings in both Houses. Sources revealed that the Union Cabinet approved the report last week, clearing the path for the introduction of the bill in the second half of the Budget Session, scheduled to begin on March 10. The proposed legislation aims to simplify the process of registering Waqf properties. The Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC), chaired by BJP leader Jagdambika Pal, recommended several amendments to the bill, though these faced opposition from rival parties. During a clause-by-clause review in January, the committee accepted all modifications put forward by members of the BJP-led NDA while rejecting every amendment proposed by the Opposition. Over the past six months, the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) conducted nearly three dozen hearings, many of which were marred by chaos, and at least one escalated into physical violence. Tensions peaked when Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee smashed a glass bottle on the table, alleging provocation by BJP's Abhijit Gangopadhyay. The committee eventually proposed 66 amendments, but a heated dispute arose when all 44 suggestions from the Opposition were rejected. Meanwhile, 23 proposals from BJP and its allies were accepted, with 14 of them cleared through voting. The JPC comprised 16 members from the BJP and its allied parties, while the Opposition had only 10 representatives. Among the 14 approved changes, one key amendment clarifies the distinction between the two mandatory non-Muslim members—originally specified in the bill's draft—and nominated ex-officio members, who may be either Muslim or non-Muslim. As a result, Waqf councils, whether at the state or national level, will include at least two non-Muslim members, with the possibility of additional non-Muslim representatives if any of the nominated ex-officio members are also from outside the Islamic faith. Another significant amendment assigns the responsibility of determining whether a property qualifies as 'waqf' to an officer appointed by the respective state government. Initially, this authority was vested in the District Collector. Additionally, the revised bill clarifies that the law will not have retrospective effect, provided the property in question is already registered. However, Congress leader and JPC member Imran Masood raised concerns over this provision, pointing out that nearly 90 percent of waqf properties remain unregistered.

Indian diplomat Kshitij Tyagi condemned Pakistan’s use of falsehoods and misuse of international platforms. He reaffirmed Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh as integral to India, pointing to the region’s progress. India also criticised Pakistan’s human rights record, urging it to focus on internal governance instead of targeting India. This statement aligns with India’s consistent stance at global forums.",

            "description": "झांसी में महाकुंभ के दरम्यान रेल मंडल से संचालित ट्रेनों ने झांसी और प्रयागराज के लिए 939 फेरे लगाए। इस दरम्यान यहां से 15 लाख से अधिक श्रद्धालुओं को प्रयागराज भेजकर रेलवे ने बड़ी जिम्मेदारी का निर्वहन किया। नेशनल हाईवे से कुंभ जाने वाले वाहनों की संख्या 3.15 लाख रही। प्रयागराज महाकुंभ के शुरू होने से पहले 10 जनवरी से रेल प्रशासन की ओर से मेला स्पेशल ट्रेनों का संचालन शुरू कर दिया गया था। लेकिन, बाद के दिनों में यात्रियों की भीड़ उमड़ने पर रेल प्रशासन को आनन-फानन अतिरिक्त ट्रेनों का भी संचालन करना पड़ गया। इस दरम्यान झांसी रेल मंडल के अलग-अलग स्टेशनों से 348 ट्रेनों को प्रयागराज के लिए रवाना किया गया। इनमें से वीरांगना लक्ष्मीबाई, झांसी रेलवे स्टेशन से 201 ट्रेनें प्रयागराज के लिए रवाना की गईं। इन सभी ट्रेनों के माध्यम से 15 लाख से अधिक श्रद्धालुओं को प्रयागराज के लिए रवाना किया गया। जबकि, लगभग इतनी ही संख्या में श्रद्धालुओं को वहां से यहां लाया गया। रेलवे के मंडलीय जनसंपर्क अधिकारी मनोज कुमार सिंह ने बताया कि रेल प्रशासन की ओर से महाकुंभ के दरम्यान व्यवस्थाओं में किसी तरह की कसर नहीं रखी गई। यात्रियों की सुविधा के साथ-साथ सुरक्षा का भी पूरा ख्याल रखा गया। सड़क से गुजरे 3.15 लाख वाहन गुजरात, राजस्थान और महाराष्ट्र से प्रयागराज जाने वाले श्रद्धालुओं के लिए महाकुंभ के दौरान झांसी प्रवेश द्वार बना रहा। इसका अंदाजा झांसी-शिवपुरी हाईवे पर स्थित रक्सा टोल प्लाजा के आंकड़ों को देखकर लगाया जा सकता है। सामान्य दिनों में यहां से रोजाना लगभग सात हजार वाहन गुजरते थे, लेकिन महाकुंभ के दौरान यह संख्या प्रतिदिन औसतन 15 हजार बनी रही। वाहनों की सबसे ज्यादा भीड़ मौनी अमावस्या के एक दिन पहले से लेकर महाकुंभ समाप्ति की पूर्व संध्या बुधवार तक बनी रही। कमोबेश यही स्थिति कानपुर रोड पर स्थिति सेमरी और एट टोल प्लाजा पर भी देखने को मिली। महाकुंभ के दौरान झांसी के हाईवे पर वाहनों का ढाई गुना तक दबाव बना रहा। इससे टोल टैक्स वसूली में भी कई गुना उछाल आया है। रक्सा टोल प्लाजा पर सामान्य तौर पर रोजाना 18-20 लाख रुपये टोल टैक्स जमा होता था। महाकुंभ के दरम्यान रोजाना औसतन 45 लाख रुपये टोल टैक्स मिला। टोल प्लाजा मैनेजर पवन शर्मा ने बताया कि महाकुंभ के दौरान हाईवे पर 24 घंटे वाहनों का भारी दबाव बना रहा। वाहनों से मिलने वाले टोल टैक्स में भी खूब इजाफा हुआ।",

            "description": "Prosecutor Declines Charges in Controversial Georgia Shooting In a controversial decision, a Georgia sheriff's deputy who fatally shot a Black man will not be criminally charged, according to local authorities. The officer, Buck Aldridge, was deemed to have used reasonable force in the October 2023 incident involving Leonard Allan Cure on Interstate 95.The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported that Aldridge attempted to subdue Cure with a Taser and baton before resorting to lethal force when Cure allegedly resisted arrest and assaulted the deputy. District Attorney Keith Higgins concluded that the use of force was justified and charges were not warranted.Critics, including civil rights attorney Ben Crump, condemned the decision as a grave injustice. Cure, who had been exonerated in 2020 after being wrongfully imprisoned for 16 years, has become the latest symbol in the ongoing debate over police brutality against Black individuals in the U.S.",

The fines totaled 4.65 billion won, a sum that works out to be just under $3.2 million.During the February 25 meeting with the Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC), Apple representatives were asked which other countries used Apple's NSF scores. According to The Korea Herald, the representatives responded by saying \"It is hard to make a public statement because we have to confer with our client.

            "description": "There's a new M4 MacBook Air reportedly on the way soon, but if you can't wait or don't need the extra power of Apple's M4 chip, you can get a M3 MacBook Air for $200 off on Amazon right now. That lowers the current MacBook Air's price from $1,099 to $899 — not the $850 low we've seen before for the Air, but pretty close. Engadget picked the M3 MacBook Air as the best MacBook overall because of its lightweight design, bright screen and the reliable performance of the M3 chip. Besides support for Wi-Fi 6E, Apple's custom silicon allows the MacBook Air to power two external displays at once, something sorely missing from the previous generation Air. The current deal only covers the Air model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage in Apple's \"Midnight\" blue finish, but that should be more than enough storage and memory for most people. If you'd still like a deal but with a few more colors to choose from, several other MacBooks are also on sale. For example, you can get an M2 MacBook Air for $200 off when you use a coupon, lowering the price from an already discounted $950 to $800. That deal applies to the Air with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage and covers multiple different colors. The M2 chip is technically less powerful than the M3, but for day-to-day computer tasks you'll get more than enough performance and battery life from an M2 MacBook Air. If you're willing to pay more and you want one of the most capable laptops Apple currently sells, you can could instead opt for a new M4 MacBook Pro for $1,399, $200 off its usual $1,599 price. Apple introduced the M4 MacBook Pros near the end of 2024 with a focus on improving graphical performance. The new MacBook Pro is the closest Apple has gotten to a gaming laptop, and it includes other upgrades, like a brighter screen and an improved webcam. The model on sale includes 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, a healthy amount to start with if you plan on using the MacBook Pro for work. All of the MacBooks on sale on Amazon also support Apple Intelligence, if you're interested in exploring Apple's approach to AI features like summarization and text generation.

            "description": "India's Development as a Global Blueprint India's approach to development could serve as a model for other nations, according to Dr. V Anantha Nageswaran, the Chief Economic Adviser to the Indian government. Speaking at a seminar attended by South African and Indian business leaders, Nageswaran discussed India's ambition to transform into a developed nation while navigating its federal and democratic governance structures.Nageswaran highlighted India's journey from a $3 trillion to a $13 trillion economy over the next 25 years, citing the ambitious Viksit Bharat plans. He underscored the importance of adaptable global partnerships and the need for countries to support each other in the current, churn-filled global environment.Other speakers, like Saki Zamxaka from the Gauteng Growth and Development Agency, identified areas such as mineral resources and manufacturing where collaboration with India could be mutually beneficial. The event highlighted India's potential as a significant player in the global economy, especially within the framework of BRICS and other international forums.",
