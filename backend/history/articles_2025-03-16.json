            "description": "Marathon Mishap: Offensive Prizes Spark Apology in Taiwan In a surprising turn of events, organizers of a marathon in southern Taiwan have issued a public apology after offending participants and the public by distributing trophies shaped like a golden Chinese machine gun. This incident, which has unearthed deep-rooted tensions, involved a high-profile lawmaker and drew criticism from various quarters.Legislator Hsu Chi-chieh from the Democratic Progressive Party, which advocates for Taiwan's independence from China, expressed regret over the misstep. Hsu clarified that featuring the image of a Chinese QBZ-95 rifle on top-winner trophies was a grave oversight, not a political statement. All recipients will be offered an alternative award, defusing potential controversy amid rising China-Taiwan tensions.The blunder inadvertently comes as President William Lai Ching-te highlighted increased vigilance against Chinese influence, labeling mainland China a 'foreign hostile force.' Furthermore, the marathon’s route highlighting Taiwan's military landscape added fuel to the fire. Despite facilitation of the event by Taiwan's defense facilities, organizers maintain the prize design was their sole decision, not the military's involvement.",

            "description": "Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and DMK President M.K. Stalin on Sunday defended the state government's decision to replace the Indian rupee symbol (₹) with the Tamil letter in the Budget logo for 2025-26, asserting that it reflected the party’s strong stance on language policy. The move has sparked sharp criticism from the BJP, with Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman condemning it as an instance of “language and regional chauvinism.” Addressing the controversy in his ‘Ungalil Oruvan’ (One Among You) video address, Stalin accused those who “dislike Tamil” of creating an unnecessary controversy. He also took a swipe at Sitharaman, alleging that she responded to the rupee symbol issue but remained silent on Tamil Nadu’s requests for central funds. \"I had released the Budget logo. We had the 'Ru' to show how determined we are in the language policy. But those who don't like Tamil made it big news,\" he said, as quoted by news agency PTI. ‘ரூ’ என்பது பெரிதானது ஏன்?#TNBudget2025-இல் எல்லாத் திட்டங்களும் எனக்கு நெருக்கமானவைதான் என்றாலும்; சில திட்டங்களை உருவாக்கியது எப்படி என்று பகிர்ந்துகொள்கிறேன்!#UngalilOruvanAnswers pic.twitter.com/oTl0Kcypq3— M.K.Stalin (@mkstalin) March 16, 2025“We had pleaded with the Union Government to give funds for a 100-day job scheme (MGNREGA), disaster management, and release school education funds. The union finance minister (Sitharaman) who did not respond to these,” Stalin remarked.He further argued that even Sitharaman had used 'Ru' in several posts and questioned why writing 'Rs' for rupees in English was acceptable but not 'Ru' in Tamil.“Even she had, in many posts, used the word 'Ru'. In English, Rupees is written simply as Rs. That doesn't matter to them, but this seems to be an issue for them. Overall, our budget was a hit across the nation, as was Tamil,” he said, adding that the change symbolised the DMK’s commitment to promoting the Tamil language. The Tamil Nadu government had earlier explained that the replacement of the rupee symbol with ‘Ru’, the first letter of ‘Rubaai’ (which denotes rupee in Tamil), was aimed at reinforcing the state’s linguistic identity. BJP Slams Stalin Govt Move, Calls It ‘Regional Chauvinism’ The BJP has strongly objected to the decision, with Sitharaman questioning the DMK’s opposition to the rupee symbol, which was officially adopted in 2010 under the Congress-led UPA government, in which the DMK was an ally. \"This is more than mere symbolism — it signals a dangerous mindset that weakens Indian unity and promotes secessionist sentiments under the pretence of regional pride. A completely avoidable example of language and regional chauvinism,\" Sitharaman wrote on X on Friday. She also pointed out that the rupee symbol was designed by D. Udaya Kumar, the son of former DMK MLA N. Dharmalingam, questioning why the party was rejecting a symbol created by a Tamilian. \"By erasing it now, the DMK is not only rejecting a national symbol but also utterly disregarding the creative contribution of a Tamil youth,\" she said. BJP IT Cell Chief Amit Malviya echoed Sitharaman’s remarks, alleging that Stalin was “insulting Tamilians” by dropping the rupee symbol. Tamil Nadu BJP President K. Annamalai also criticised the DMK government, questioning the logic behind replacing a nationally recognised currency symbol. \"The DMK government’s Budget for 2025-26 replaces the rupee symbol, which was designed by a Tamilian and adopted by the entire nation. How stupid can you become, Thiru @mkstalin?\" Annamalai posted on X. AIADMK General Secretary and Leader of the Opposition Edappadi K. Palaniswami dismissed the move as a mere publicity stunt to divert attention from governance failures. In a social media post, he accused Stalin of indulging in “empty advertisement campaigns” rather than addressing people's real needs. \"CM Stalin is delivering scripted dialogues written by others. This is nothing but a political gimmick,\" he said, as per PTI. The controversy over the Tamil Rupee symbol comes amid ongoing tensions between the DMK-led Tamil Nadu government and the BJP-led Union government over language policies. Stalin reiterated that his government would uphold Tamil Nadu’s two-language formula (Tamil and English) and resist any attempts to impose Hindi through the National Education Policy (NEP). CM Stalin On Tamil Nadu Budget\"The budget we presented on Friday has received all-round accolades. Some may criticise it constructively, but others only have vendetta against us,\" Stalin said, defending the government’s economic policies. He also highlighted efforts to contain the state’s debt and reiterated the DMK’s goal of making Tamil Nadu a $1 trillion economy by 2030. Additionally, Stalin warned about potential threats such as a reduction in Lok Sabha seats post-delimitation and issues related to central fund allocation, stating that the state government would continue striving for Tamil Nadu’s rights and justice.",

But the cricket icon believes it’s time to shift the focus towards educating viewers about the sport and athletes' real struggles.\"A broadcast show needs to talk about the game and not what I ate yesterday for lunch...\" – Virat Kohli",

            "description": "Lex Fridman, computer scientist and podcaster revealed that he fasted for 45 hours, consuming only water, in honour of his interview with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. \"So, I should also say I'm fasting right now. It's been almost two days, 45 hours, so just water, no food in honour of this conversation, just to get in the right mindset, get into the spiritual level. I have read that you often fast for many days,\" Fridman said, asking PM Modi to share his experience of fasting. PM Modi also shared his perspective on fasting, emphasizing its benefits in sharpening the senses, enhancing mental clarity, and instilling discipline. He explained that fasting is a scientific process rather than merely skipping meals and is deeply connected to traditional and Ayurvedic practices. Also read: PM Modi's podcast with Lex Fridman: Opens up about role of RSS, Gujarat riots, Indo-Pak ties and more (WATCH) \"First of all, I'm truly pleasantly surprised and honoured that you're fasting, all the more because it feels like you're fasting as a tribute of respect for me. So, I express my deepest gratitude to you for doing this. In India, our religious traditions are actually a way of life. Our Supreme Court once gave a brilliant interpretation of Hinduism. They have stated that Hinduism is not about rituals or methods of worship, but rather it's a way of living, a philosophy that guides life itself. And in our scriptures, there is deep discussion on elevating the body, mind, intellect, soul, and humanity. They outline various paths, traditions, and systems to achieve this, and fasting is one of them, but fasting alone is not everything. In India, whether you see it culturally or philosophically, sometimes I see that fasting is a way to cultivate discipline, \" PM Modi said. PM Modi stated that fasting is a direct bearing on the thinking process and sharpens one's perspective and termed it as a scientific process. \"It is a powerful tool to bring both the inner and outer self into balance. It shapes life in profound ways when you fast. You may have noticed, as you said, you've been fasting on water for two days. Every single one of your senses, especially smell, touch and taste, becomes highly sensitive. You may even notice the subtle aroma of water itself, something you probably never noticed before when drinking it. If someone walks past you carrying tea, you will catch its aroma just like you would with coffee. A small flower you've seen before, you will see it again today, but now you can perceive its details more vividly. Your senses become extra sharp, highly aware, and fully tuned in, and their capability to observe and to respond multiplies, and grows sharper. I have personally often experienced this,\" the Prime Minister said. \"Another thing I've experienced is that fasting can greatly accelerate the thinking process, and can give a fresh perspective. You start thinking outside the box. I don't know if everyone experiences this, but I certainly do. Most people assume that fasting simply means giving up food or not eating, but that is just the physical aspect of fasting. If someone is forced to go without food due to hardship with an empty stomach, can we call that fasting? Fasting is actually a scientific process. Whenever I fast for an extended period, I prepare my body in advance. For five to seven days before the fast, I follow various Ayurvedic practices and yoga practices, along with other traditional cleansing methods to internally reset my system,\" PM Modi added. PM Modi mentioned that he hydrates well before fasting to aid in body detoxification. He also noted that rather than feeling sluggish, fasting makes him more energetic and allows him to work even harder. \"Before actually beginning the fast. I make sure to drink a lot of water, as much as possible. So, you could say that this detoxification process helps prepare my body in the best possible way. And once I begin fasting, for me, it's an act of devotion. For me, fasting is a form of self-discipline. For me personally, even while I go about doing my daily activities during a fast, my mind remains deeply introspective and focused inward, and that experience is profoundly transformative for me. My practice of fasting did not come from reading books, listening to sermons, or following a tradition just because my family happened to have observed it. It came from my own personal experience,\" PM Modi added. PM Narendra Modi in the podcast with Lex Fridman has spoken on a wide range of subjects outlining his vision for the country.",

Recently, broader interest stems from the amended 2021-30 policy, attracting investors from across India's regions.Focus sectors include manufacturing, IT, agriculture, and tourism. Deputy Chief Minister Surinder Choudhary highlighted various policy efforts to promote industry growth, emphasizing the importance of attracting women-led enterprises to these new developments.",

            "description": "Shah Rukh Khan’s Baazigar (1993) remains an iconic Bollywood thriller. However, not every cast member enjoyed the fruits of its success. Adi Irani, who portrayed Vicky Malhotra in the film, recently shared a heart-wrenching account of his financial struggles in the years that followed. Despite being part of a hit movie alongside SRK and Kajol, Adi faced hardships that left him unable to afford even basic necessities for his family. In a candid interview with Filmytantra Media, Adi Irani, brother of veteran actress Aruna Irani, reflected on his post-Baazigar life.A Father’s Struggle: Couldn’t Afford Milk for His DaughterAdi Irani’s revelations paint a stark picture of his financial woes. Recalling the birth of his first daughter in 1995, he said, “My first daughter was born in 1995, and at that point in time, milk cost Rs 5, and sometimes I did not even have that.”To make ends meet, Adi relied on a borrowed scooter from a friend to scour the city for job opportunities. “Every day I had to go out into the city and meet people for jobs and roles,” he shared. However, even this lifeline came with its own challenges. “Sometimes I did not even have money to fill up the tank,” he admitted. On days when petrol was out of reach, Adi resorted to walking to the bus stop, a humbling experience for an actor who had once shared the screen with Bollywood’s biggest names.Hiding the Truth: Sneaking Home From the Bus StopHe recounted how he would walk to the bus stop when he couldn’t afford fuel, only to face curious onlookers. “People used to ask me, ‘What are you doing at a bus stop?’ and I used to lie and say that I was just waiting for a friend,” he said. When pressed further with questions like, “Why would you need to travel on a bus?” Adi would quietly slip away, sneaking back home to avoid further scrutiny.Refusing Help From Sister Aruna IraniAdi Irani’s struggles were not unknown to his family, particularly his sister, Aruna Irani, a well-known actress in her own right. When asked if she offered support, Adi revealed, “My sister knew about my situation and offered her help many times, but I refused.” His decision stemmed from a sense of independence and responsibility. “I am her brother, but that doesn’t mean that she will take care of me all her life; that was my own struggle, and moreover, she had a family of her own to care for,” he explained.Adi Irani’s acting credits extend beyond Baazigar. He also appeared in Salman Khan and Preity Zinta’s Chori Chori Chupke Chupke (2001) and Welcome (2007), among other projects.Also Read: Adi Irani calls out Zoya Akhtar for ‘unprofessionalism’ over Dil Dhadakne Do casting shake-up: “Everybody wants to be a diplomat”",

His message comes at a time when debutant Ibrahim Ali Khan, alongside co-star Khushi Kapoor, are facing intense online criticism following the release of their Netflix film Nadaaniyaan.On Saturday, March 15, 2025, Sood took to his social media handles to share a powerful message: “Be kind to debutants in the film fraternity and elsewhere. Nobody was perfect when they started. We all learn with experience. Only a handful get a second chance.

Directed by Shauna Gautam and produced by Karan Johar, Apoorva Mehta, and Somen Mishra under Dharmatic Entertainment, the film also stars Khushi Kapoor, daughter of the late Sridevi and Boney Kapoor. The romantic comedy boasts a strong supporting cast, including Mahima Chaudhary, Suniel Shetty, Dia Mirza, and Jugal Hansraj.Despite its promising lineup, Nadaaniyaan has faced a barrage of trolling, with Ibrahim Ali Khan bearing the brunt of online backlash. Critics and viewers have targeted the film’s dialogues and performances.Speaking of the professional front, Sonu was last seen in Fateh, which also marked his directorial debut. Despite the buzz, the film did not perform at the box office as expected. The actor is yet to announce any of his upcoming projects.Also Read:Kareena Kapoor Khan pens sweet birthday wish for Ibrahim Ali Khan, calls him “The best boy”",

            "description": "The Kerala High Court has observed that the notion that no woman would falsely accuse someone of sexual assault has lost its absolute validity in recent years. The court acknowledged that while many such allegations are genuine, a small fraction of them are fabricated, often weaponized for personal vendettas or coercive gains. According to TOI report, Justice A Badharudeen made these remarks while quashing a case against a young man from Pattambi, who was accused of sexually exploiting a woman between May 30, 2014, and April 20, 2019, by allegedly misleading her with a false promise of marriage. The bench further emphasized that such accusations should not be accepted at face value without thoroughly verifying the circumstances of each case. “False allegations,” the court noted, “are sometimes used to settle personal scores or to pressure the accused into fulfilling unlawful demands.” Also read: Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan calls high-level meeting to tackle rising drug use in state The single-judge bench scrutinized the timeline of the case and found discrepancies that weakened the complainant’s claims. Despite the alleged first instance of assault occurring in May 2014, the complaint was officially registered only in April 2019. Interestingly, the woman had initially filed a complaint in 2016 with the Women’s Cell, Palakkad, but chose not to pursue it after the accused reportedly reaffirmed his commitment to marry her. The complainant later submitted an affidavit stating she had no objections to dropping the charges, further reinforcing doubts about the allegations. After a review of the case records, the bench concluded that the relationship between the two parties was consensual and thus quashed the case.

            "description": "Temple Intrigue: Priests Arrested for Chemical Attack on Accountant In a shocking incident, two priests have been taken into custody in connection with a chemical attack on a temple accountant in Saidabad. The accountant suffered injuries to his scalp and face after an unknown liquid was thrown on him by an assailant at Shri Bhulakshmi Maata temple.The troubling incident unfolded on March 14 when a masked individual, under the guise of inquiring about the temple's annadanam program, attacked the unsuspecting accountant, later fleeing the scene with a chilling 'Happy Holi'. Authorities have since registered an attempt to murder case.Police investigations revealed that the temple's second priest orchestrated the attack, suspecting the accountant of misappropriating funds and holding personal grudges. This act was executed with the help of the first priest, resulting in their arrest, as detailed by Deputy Commissioner of Police Patil Kantilal Subhash.",

            "description": "Elon Musk Starlink: भारत में हाई-स्पीड इंटरनेट सर्विस के लिए एयरटेल और रिलायंस जियो ने एलन मस्क की कंपनी स्टारलिंक के साथ समझौता किया है. अब सवाल यह आता है कि क्या स्टारलिंक से आने वाले समय में जियो और एयरटेल को कोई खतरा है? क्यों नहीं एयरटेल और जियो को स्टारलिंक से खतरा?ब्रोकरेज फर्म जेएम फाइनेंशियल की रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, स्टारलिंक की सैटेलाइट ब्रॉडबैंड सर्विस से भारत में टेलीकॉम सेक्टर की दो बड़ी कंपनियों एयरटेल और जियो को कोई खतरे की संभावना नहीं है क्योंकि होम ब्रॉडबैंड प्लान की कीमत भी सही है, स्पीड भी बढ़िया है और डेटा भी अनलिमिटेड है. इसके बजाय स्टारलिंक की सेवा से दूरसंचार कंपनियों के मौजूदा नेटवर्क को और मजबूती मिलेगी, जिससे दूरदराज और ग्रामीण क्षेत्रों में हाई-स्पीड इंटरनेट एक्सेस का विस्तार करने में मदद मिलेगी.इतनी है इनके प्लान की कीमतस्टारलिंक और अन्य सैटकॉम कंपनियों की सैटेलाइट इंटरनेट प्लान की कीमत प्रति माह 10 से 500 अमेरिकी डॉलर के बीच में होती है. इसके अलावा, 250-380 अमेरिकी डॉलर तक वन टाइम हार्डवेयर कॉस्ट भी शामिल है. इसके विपरीत, भारत में टेलीकॉम कंपनियों की होम ब्रॉडबैंड प्लान की कीमत 5 से 7 अमेरिकी डॉलर के बीच होती है, जबकि प्रीमियम प्लान की कीमत 47 डॉलर तक होती है, जो 1 Gbps की स्पीड से स्ट्रीमिंग सर्विसेज प्रदान करती है. इसके अलावा, स्टारलिंक के प्लान में डेटाकैप होते हैं, जबकि जियो और एयरटेल अनलिमिटेड डेटा देते हैं. इनके साथ भी स्टारलिंक की पार्टनरशिपस्टारलिंक भारतीय बाजारों के हिसाब से अधिक कीमती है, जबकि देश की टेलीकॉम कंपनियां किफायती हैं. ऐसे में इनके बीच, मुकाबला होने का कोई सवाल ही पैदा नहीं होता है. एयरटेल और जियो के बीच स्टारलिंक का मौजूदा एग्रीमेंट मुख्य रूप से डिस्ट्रीब्यूशन पर आधारित है. आने वाले समय में डायरेक्ट-टू-सेल सैटेलाइट सर्विस के लिए जियो, एयरटेल और स्टारलिंक के बीच सहयोग होने की संभावना है. बता दें कि स्टारलिंक ने सैटेलाइट कनेक्टिविटी प्रदान करने के लिए टी-मोबाइल (अमेरिका), रोजर्स (कनाडा), ऑप्टस (ऑस्ट्रेलिया) और केडीडीआई (जापान) जैसी दूरसंचार कंपनियों के साथ पार्टनरशिप की है. ये भी पढ़ें:Share Market: अगली पीढ़ी के अमीर भारतीयों को लुभा रहा शेयर बाजार, इक्विटी में निवेश है सबसे पंसदीदा इंवेस्टमेंट",

            "description": "Mumbai Indians Triumph in WPL Final with Strategic Early Wickets In a dramatic Women's Premier League final, Mumbai Indians clinched victory against Delhi Capitals, thanks to a strategic early bowling attack. MI head coach Charlotte Edwards highlighted the significance of dismissing DC's captain Meg Lanning and opener Shafali Verma early on, which helped set the tone for the match.The Capitals struggled to build momentum, with Lanning and Shafali departing at just 17 runs on the board. Edwards praised the contributions of MI’s captain Harmanpreet Kaur, who scored a crucial 66 off 44 balls, ensuring a competitive score for the team despite a modest total.Edwards also acknowledged the invaluable efforts of all-rounders Nat Sciver-Brunt and Hayley Matthews, whose performances throughout the tournament were instrumental. Brunt emerged as the highest run-scorer, while Matthews shared the top spot for most wickets taken. The team's resilience was evident, even as they played multiple matches in quick succession.",

He had been evading capture for a long time and was listed among India’s most-wanted terrorists. Security agencies had been closely monitoring his movements due to his involvement in multiple terror-related activities.Although specific details about his death remain uncertain, sources indicate that his elimination marks a significant blow to terror networks associated with Hafiz Saeed. His killing is considered a major success in counterterrorism operations, as he was reportedly engaged in planning attacks against India.Indian intelligence agencies had been actively searching for him due to his strong ties with terror outfits operating in Pakistan. His demise raises critical questions about the shifting dynamics within terrorist organizations and the ongoing security measures in the region.",

            "description": "South African Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool said on Friday that US President Donald Trump is leading. A white supremacist movement in America and around the world. According to the website Breitbart, Rasool, while addressing the Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection (MISTRA) in Johannesburg, said that white supremacism was motivating Trump’s disrespect for the current hegemonic order of the world, including institutions like the United Nations and the G-20. Rasool also said that the Make America Great Again movement was a white supremacist response to growing demographic diversity in the United States and suggested that South African farmers who had present Afrikaner grievances with the US were part of that global effort.According to the report, he further added that South Africa could lead the pushback to Trump’s white supremacism since the country was the historical antidote to supremacism. He also said that South Africa could also encourage Trump’s “healthy disrespect” for global institutions that South Africa feels are dominated by the West and added that the stance of Trump was like “a broken clock being right twice a day.”Rasool explained that what Trump is launching is an assault on incumbency, those who are in power, by mobilising a supremacism against the incumbency, at home, and—I think I’ve illustrated—abroad as well. “So in terms of that, the supremacist assault on incumbency, we see it in the domestic politics of the USA, the MAGA movement, the Make America Great Again movement, as a response not simply to a supremacist instinct but to very clear data that shows great demographic shifts in the USA in which the voting electorate in the USA is projected to become 48% white. And that the possibility of a majority of minorities is looming on the horizon,” he added.Rasool also admitted to the seminar that South Africa lacked the ability to play the US and China off against each other as the trade with the US was more valuable.",

            "description": "USA News: अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप ने शनिवार को रेड सी शिपिंग पर हुए हमलों के जवाब में यमन के ईरान समर्थित हूती विद्रोहियों के खिलाफ व्यापक सैन्य कार्रवाई शुरू की, जिसमें कम से कम 24 लोगों की मौत हो गई. ट्रंप ने चेतावनी देते हुए कहा कि अगर हूती विद्रोही हमले जारी रखते हैं, तो उनकी स्थिति नरक से भी बदतर हो जाएगी. उन्होंने ईरान को भी चेतावनी दी है कि वह तुरंत हूतियों का समर्थन बंद करे. ट्रंप ने साफ किया, 'अगर ईरान ने अमेरिका को धमकी दी, तो अमेरिका कोई नरमी नहीं दिखाएगा.''हफ्तों जारी रह सकते हैं हमले'रायटर्स की रिपोर्ट के अनुसार, एक अधिकारी ने इन हमलों की जानकारी देते हुए कहा कि शायद ये हमले हफ्तों तक जारी रह सकता है. गौरतलब है कि ट्रंप के जनवरी में राष्ट्रपति पद संभालने के बाद यह मध्य पूर्व में अमेरिकी सेना द्वारा किया गया अब तक का सबसे बड़ा सैन्य हमला है. ये हमले ऐसे समय में हो रहे हैं जब अमेरिका तेहरान पर आर्थिक दबाव बढ़ा रहा है और उसे अपने परमाणु कार्यक्रम को लेकर बातचीत के लिए राजी करने की कोशिश कर रहा है.'प्रतिक्रिया करने के लिए पूरी तरह से तैयार'यमन की राजधानी साना में अमेरिकी हमलों में कम से कम 13 नागरिकों की मौत हो गई, जबकि 9 लोग घायल हो गए. इस बारे में जानकारी हूती नियंत्रित स्वास्थ्य मंत्रालय ने दी है. वहीं, यमन के उत्तरी प्रांत सादा में हुए एक अन्य अमेरिकी हमले में छह लोगों की जान गई, जिनमें चार बच्चे और एक महिला शामिल थीं. इस हमले में 11 लोग घायल भी हुए हैं.हूतियों के एक प्रवक्ता ने कहा कि उनकी सेना विस्फोटक कार्रवाई के साथ जवाब देने के लिए पूरी तरह तैयार है. साना के निवासियों ने बताया कि एक हूती ठिकाने को निशाना बनाया गया, जिससे इतने जोरदार धमाके हुए कि पूरा मोहल्ला हिल गया.'बना रहा है शिपिंग जहाजों को निशाना'हूतियों ने नवंबर 2023 से अब तक शिपिंग पर 100 से अधिक हमले किए हैं, जिससे अमेरिकी सेना को मिसाइलों और ड्रोन हमलों को रोकने के लिए कई अभियान चलाने पड़े. हूती इस संघर्ष को गाजा में हमास और इजराइल के युद्ध में फिलिस्तीनियों के प्रति अपनी एकजुटता के रूप में दिखाने की कोशिश कर रहा है. अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति जो बाइडेन की पिछली सरकार ने हूतियों की शिपिंग हमलों की क्षमता को कमजोर करने की कोशिश की थी, लेकिन यह कार्रवाई सीमित रही थी. अधिकारियों के अनुसार, ट्रंप ने अब अधिक आक्रामक रुख अपनाने को मंजूरी दे दी है.",

            "description": "मेरी मां और नानी देवदासी थीं। मुझे भी इसमें धकेल दिया। परिवार संभालने के नाम पर सेक्स वर्कर बन गई। इस बीच दो बच्चे हो गए। दोनों स्कूल जाते हैं। वहां लोग उनसे पिता का नाम पूछते हैं। उनको बहुत शर्मिंदगी होती है। यह कहानी कर्नाटक में 41 साल की शोबा मथाड और उन जैसी 46 हजार से ज्यादा महिलाओं की है, जिन्हें भगवान की कथित सेवा के नाम पर मंदिरों में देवदासी बना दिया गया था। इसके बाद वे यौन शोषण और प्रताड़ना का शिकार हुईं। कर्नाटक में 1982 में लड़कियों को देवदासी बनाने की प्रथा के खिलाफ कानून लाया गया। तब से सरकारें दावा करती आई हैं कि यह प्रथा बंद हो गई है। हालांकि, चोरी-छिपे लड़कियां आज भी इस दलदल में धकेली जाती हैं। लड़कियों को अब उनका परिवार देवदासी बनाने के बाद देह व्यापार के लिए दूसरे राज्यों में भेज देता है। दैनिक भास्कर ने इस प्रथा की जमीनी हकीकत समझने के लिए 8 दिन तक बगलकोटे, बेलगावी, धारवाड़, विजयनगर और कोप्पल जिलों का दौरा किया। इस दौरान देवदासियाें, उनके परिवारों से बात कर पूरा मामला समझने की कोशिश की। पढ़िए यह ग्राउंड रिपोर्ट।दैनिक भास्कर ने बेलगावी जिले के हल्लूर गांव में मनोहर से बात की। उन्होंने अपनी बेटी सपना को देवदासी बनाने के बाद महाराष्ट्र में देह व्यापार के लिए भेज दिया है। नेहा नाम की एक दूसरी युवती ने बताया कि उसकी कहानी भी मिलती-जुलती है। ये अपनी पहचान नहीं बताना चाहते हैं, इसलिए हमने इनके नाम बदल दिए हैं। दो देवदासियों की कहानी, जो महाराष्ट्र में सेक्स वर्कर हैं... 1. सपना की कहानी : 5 बहनों को पिता पाल नहीं सके, एक को महाराष्ट्र भेजामनोहर ने बताया कि उनकी 5 बेटियां हैं। सपना सबसे बड़ी है। इसलिए उसे देवदासी बना दिया। वह कहते हैं, 'यह सब भगवान की इच्छा से होता है। उन्होंने ही 5-5 बेटियां दे दीं। एक बेटा नहीं दिया। मैं और मेरी पत्नी खेत में मजदूरी करते हैं। उस कमाई से 7 लोगों का परिवार चलाना बहुत मुश्किल था। बेटियों को पढ़ाना-लिखाना तो दूर की बात है।' 'मेरी चाची और बहनें देवदासी बनने के बाद दूसरे राज्यों में सेक्स वर्कर हैं। अच्छे पैसे कमाती हैं। इसलिए जब हमारी बड़ी बेटी थोड़ी बड़ी हुई, तो उसे मंदिर ले गए। वहां देवदासी बनाने के बाद उसे महाराष्ट्र भेज दिया। अब वह भी पैसे कमाकर हमें भेजती है। उसी से परिवार चलता है।' 2. नेहा की कहानी : मन होता है यह काम छोड़कर भाग जाऊं, लेकिन परिवार मेरे भरोसेकर्नाटक के बागलकोट जिले के रबकावी-बनहट्टी शहर की नेहा महाराष्ट्र के सांगली में सेक्स वर्कर हैं। वह बताती हैं, 'हम 3 बहनें और एक भाई हैं। मैं सबसे बड़ी हूं। नाबालिग थी, तभी घरवालों ने देवदासी बना दिया। माता-पिता पढ़े-लिखे नहीं हैं। दिहाड़ी करके हम चारों भाई-बहन को पालते थे।' 'मम्मी-पापा ने कहा कि मेरे देवदासी बनने से उनकी जिंदगी आसान हो जाएगी। इसलिए मैं भी मान गई, लेकिन सेक्स वर्कर बनने के बाद मेरी जिंदगी बहुत मुश्किल हो गई है। बहुत बार मन होता है कि कहीं भाग जाऊं, लेकिन घरवालों का चेहरा याद आ जाता है। उनकी उम्मीद तोड़ने की हिम्मत नहीं होती। मेरे कमाए पैसों से ही मेरे भाई-बहनों का भविष्य सुधर सकता है। अब शोबा और उनके जैसी पूर्व देवदासियों की कहानी... 'डॉक्टरों ने इलाज नहीं किया, सबको लगता था मुझे HIV होगा'शोबा मथाड कोप्पल जिले के हिरेसिंदोगी गांव में रहती हैं। वह बताती हैं, 'मेरे परिवार में लड़कियों को देवदासी बनाने की परंपरा थी। मेरी नानी देवदासी थी। मां विकलांग थी, इसलिए नानी ने उन्हें देवदासी बना दिया था।' 'मैं दोनों का इकलौता सहारा थी। इसलिए मुझे भी कम उम्र में सेक्स वर्कर बना दिया। देवदासी बनने के बाद मुझे एक लड़का पसंद आ गया। वह दूसरी जाति का था। हम दोनों शादी करना चाहते थे, लेकिन उसके घरवालों ने मुझे अपनाने से इनकार कर दिया।' 'फिर मैं प्रेग्नेंट हो गई। अबॉर्शन करवाने के लिए कई अस्पतालों में गई, लेकिन किसी डॉक्टर ने मेरा इलाज नहीं किया। सबको लगता था मुझे HIV होगा। उस दिन मैंने फैसला किया कि अपनी गलतियों की सजा अपने बच्चे को नहीं दूंगी। मैंने बच्चे को जन्म दिया। बाद में एक बेटी भी हुई।' शोबा बताती हैं, 'मैंने सोचा था यह काम छोड़ने के बाद समाज में सिर उठाकर जिएंगे, लेकिन हमारे माथे पर लगा कलंक शायद कभी नहीं हटेगा। मेरा बेटा 12वीं और बेटी 8वीं में पढ़ती है। स्कूल में जब वह सिर्फ मां का नाम बताते हैं, तो उनसे जानबूझकर पिता का नाम पूछा जाता है। इससे उन्हें बहुत शर्मिंदा होना पड़ता है।' 'जब तक देह व्यापार छोड़ा, 3 बच्चों की मां बन चुकी थी'बेलगावी जिले के मुदाल्गी शहर की 45 साल की यशोदा गस्ती कहती हैं, 'मैं मां-बाप की इकलौती बेटी थी। पापा बहुत शराब पीते थे। घर की आर्थिक हालत ठीक नहीं थी। मेरे 8वीं क्लास में जाते ही दादी देवदासी बनने का दबाव डालने लगीं। मुझे भी लगा पैसे कमाऊंगी तो घरवालों की देखभाल कर सकूंगी। इसलिए मैं मान गई।' 'हालांकि मुझे बहुत जल्दी एहसास हो गया था कि देवदासियों की जिंदगी कितनी बदतर होती है। जब तक ये काम छोड़ने का फैसला किया, तब तक मेरे तीन बच्चे हो चुके थे। दो बेटियां और एक बेटा है। बड़ी बेटी की शादी कर दी है। दूसरी बेटी नर्सिंग की पढ़ाई कर रही है। बेटा 10वीं में पढ़ता है।' 'मोतियों की माला, चूड़ियां पहनकर स्कूल गई, सब घूरने लगे'बागलकोट जिले की रेणुका गाडी (50 साल) और मधु नादुविनमणि (45 साल) को 7 से 10 साल की उम्र में देवदासी बना दिया गया था। मधु अपने माता-पिता की इकलौती संतान थी। वहीं, रेणुका की दादी ने उन्हें सिर्फ इसलिए देवदासी बना दिया, क्योंकि वह अपने परिवार की पहली बेटी थीं। रेणुका कहती हैं, 'मैं पहली क्लास में थी, जब मुझे देवदासी बना दिया। अगले दिन मैं स्कूल चली गई। मेरे दोनों हाथों में हरी चूड़ियां, गले में मोतियों की माला, पैरों में अंगूठियां थीं। सब बच्चे मुझे ही घूर रहे थे। 11 साल की हुई तो घरवालों ने सेक्स वर्कर बनने पर मजबूर कर दिया। दो बच्चों की मां बनने के बाद इस प्रथा से बाहर निकलने का फैसला किया।' 'मां ने पुजारी के कहने पर मुझे देवदासी बनाया' 50 साल की शोबा गस्ती बेलगावी जिले के घटप्रभा में रहती हैं। वह कहती हैं, 'हम तीन भाई और तीन बहनें थीं। मैं सबसे छोटी। दो साल की थी, जब पापा का देहांत हो गया। घर में कोई कमाने वाला नहीं था। मां ने बड़ी बहन को देवदासी बना दिया, लेकिन उसने दूसरे समुदाय के लड़के के साथ शादी कर ली और घर छोड़ दिया।’ 'उसके जाने के बाद मेरी मां ने एक दिन सपना देखा कि मेरा भाई जोगप्पा (हिजड़ा) बन गया है। वह डर गई और एक पुजारी के पास चली गई। पुजारी ने कहा कि तुम्हारी बड़ी बेटी ने शादी करके पाप किया है। अब येल्लम्मा देवी के श्राप से बचना है तो अपनी छोटी बेटी को देवदासी बना दो, नहीं तो तुम्हारा बेटा जोगप्पा बन जाएगा।' शोबा आगे बताती हैं, 'मां पुजारी की बातें सुनकर और डर गईं। उन्होंने घर आकर सबसे कह दिया कि मुझे देवदासी बनना होगा। मेरे भाइयों ने विरोध किया, लेकिन मां जिद पर अड़ गई थीं। वो मुझे येलम्मा मंदिर ले गईं और देवदासी बना दिया। अगले दिन घर पर बहुत बड़ी दावत बुलाई गई।' 'तब तक मैंने 7वीं की परीक्षा पास कर ली थी। 8वीं में एडमिशन लेना था, लेकिन 800 रुपए महीना फीस थी। मां नगर पंचायत में काम करके लगभग 1500 रुपए कमाती थी। उन्होंने मेरी फीस देने से मना कर दिया। कहा, अब देवदासियों वाला काम करो और पैसे कमाओ।' शोबा कहती है, 'मैंने भी ठान लिया था कि अपनी पढ़ाई पूरी करूंगी। मेरे जीजा ने इसका फायदा उठाया। उन्होंने स्कूल फीस देने के बदले मेरा शोषण शुरू कर दिया। घरवालों को भी इससे आपत्ति नहीं थी, क्योंकि मैं देवदासी थी। मैं 10वीं क्लास में प्रेग्नेंट हो गई। जैसे-तैसे परीक्षा देने के बाद पढ़ाई छोड़ दी।' शोबा बोलीं- अब भी लड़कियां देवदासी बन रहीं, लेकिन कार्रवाई नहीं होतीशोबा अब देवदासी प्रथा से बाहर निकल चुकी हैं और अपने जैसी महिलाओं के साथ इसके खिलाफ जागरूकता फैलाती हैं। इसमें सरकार के साथ-साथ कई NGO और सेल्फ हेल्प ग्रुप्स भी उनकी मदद करते हैं। शोबा दावा करती हैं कि दलित परिवारों में आज भी 20-21 साल की लड़कियों को चोरी-छिपे देवदासी बनाया जाता है। हाल की कोई घटना आपको याद है। इस पर शोबा बताती हैं, 'अरबावी गांव में, एक कपल की सात बेटियां हैं। उन्होंने अपनी सबसे बड़ी बेटी को देवदासी बना दिया। हमने बहुत रोका, लेकिन इसके बावजूद लड़की को महाराष्ट्र भेज दिया। हम अभी भी लड़की और उसके परिवार को समझाने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं।' 'बेलगावी जिले के चिक्कोडी पंचायत में हमने 18 साल की विकलांग लड़की को देवदासी बनने से रोका। उसे सब कहते थे कि तुम्हारी शादी नहीं होगी। हमने समझाया कि विकलांगता के कारण देवदासी बनना गलत है। फिर उसने हिम्मत दिखाई और घरवालों को मना कर दिया। अब उसकी शादी भी हो गई है।' शोबा बताती हैं, 'पहले लड़कियां देवदासी बनने के बाद मंदिरों में रहती थीं। अब पुलिस-प्रशासन के डर से परिवार के लोग उसे घर ले आते हैं। उसके शरीर से साज-श्रृंगार की सभी चीजें निकाल देते हैं, ताकि किसी को शक न हो। इसके बाद उसे दूसरे राज्यों में भेज देते हैं।' '2000 रुपए पेंशन, दूसरी सरकारी योजनाओं का फायदा नहीं मिलता'कोप्पल जिले के हिरेसिंडोगी गांव में 36 साल की शशिकला कहती हैं, 'सरकार देवदासी महिलाओं को हर महीने 2000 रुपए पेंशन देती है। इतने में आज के समय में क्या होता है। इसे बढ़ाना चाहिए। घर बनाने के लिए भी सिर्फ 1.8 लाख रुपए मिलते हैं। वो भी तब अगर खुद की जमीन है। ' 'दलितों और गरीबों के लिए इतनी सरकारी योजनाएं हैं, लेकिन किसी का फायदा नहीं मिलता। हम किसी से जुड़ नहीं सकते क्योंकि एप्लिकेशन फॉर्म पर पति का नाम भरना जरूरी होता है। इससे नई पीढ़ी के बच्चे भी परेशान हैं। उनसे हर जगह पिता का नाम पूछा जाता है। पति या पिता का नाम पूछने का सिस्टम खत्म होना चाहिए।' पुजारी बोले- हमने देवदासी प्रथा का हमेशा विरोध कियाहमने अभी तक लड़कियों को देवदासी बनाने की घटनाओं पर येल्लम्मा मंदिर के एक पुजारी से बात की। उन्होंने पहचान उजागर नहीं करने की शर्त पर कहा, ‘सालों पहले क्या होता था, यह मुझे नहीं पता। हालांकि अब ऐसा नहीं होता है।' 'मेरे दादा और पिता भी पुजारी थे। दोनों इस प्रथा के सख्त खिलाफ थे। पहले देवदासी बनाने में पुजारियों के रोल को लेकर बहुत सारी अफवाहें थीं। सब कहते थे कि पुजारी लड़कियों को मंगलसूत्र पहनाते थे, लेकिन यह सच नहीं है। ' पुलिस अधिकारी बोले- कुछ सालों से कोई शिकायत नहीं मिलीकोप्पल जिले के एक पुलिस अधिकारी ने ऑफ कैमरा बताया कि पिछले कुछ सालों से लड़कियों को देवदासी बनाने का कोई मामला सामने नहीं आया है। अगर भविष्य में कोई शिकायत मिलेगी, तो हम FIR दर्ज करने के लिए तैयार हैं। कर्नाटक की ये खबरें भी पढ़ें...

            "description": "'अगर मैं ग्वालियर में घर पर हूं और मुझे सब्जी मंडी जाना पड़े तो मैं साइकिल से जाऊंगा। मीटिंग में समय है, तो हमें साइकिल से जाना चाहिए। कुछ देर हम गर्मी में बिना एसी के बैठ जाएंगे तो क्या नुकसान होगा।' ये कहना है मध्यप्रदेश के ऊर्जा मंत्री प्रद्युम्न सिंह तोमर का। उन्होंने एक साल तक बिना प्रेस किए कपड़े पहनने का फैसला लिया है। इससे पहले भी वे कभी नाले में उतरकर सफाई करने और जूते-चप्पल नहीं पहनने के संकल्प को लेकर चर्चा में रह चुके हैं। इस बार उनके बिना प्रेस किए कपड़े पहनने की पहल को कांग्रेस ने नौटंकी बताया है। चर्चा में बने रहने के लिए पब्लिसिटी स्टंट करार दिया है। इसके जवाब में तोमर ने कांग्रेस पर पलटवार करते हुए कहा- चर्चा में बने रहने से उन्हें किसने रोका है? बिना प्रेस किए कपड़े पहनने और अब सब्जी मंडी तक साइकिल चलाने का फैसला मंत्री ने अचानक क्यों लिया? क्या वो पर्यावरण को लेकर वाकई गंभीर होने लगे हैं या सचमुच ये पब्लिसिटी स्टंट है? ये समझने के लिए हमने ऊर्जा मंत्री प्रद्युम्न सिंह तोमर से बातचीत की... पढ़िए एमपी के ऊर्जा मंत्री के साथ दैनिक भास्कर की बातचीत... सवाल: आपने बिना प्रेस किए कपड़े पहनने का फैसला क्यों लिया? जवाब: एक साल तक मैं बिना प्रेस किए कपड़े पहनूंगा। ये एक छोटा सा निर्णय है, लेकिन हम सब यदि छोटे-छोटे निर्णय लेंगे तो समाज में बड़े बदलाव आ जाएंगे। एक प्रेस करने में लगभग आधा यूनिट बिजली खर्च होती है। इससे कार्बन डाइऑक्साइड भी पैदा होता है, जो वातावरण में प्रदूषण पैदा करने में सहायक होता है। ऐसे अनेक कारण हैं। मेरे मन ने कहा कि हमारे किसी परिजन के लंग्स में प्रॉब्लम होती है, तो कहते हैं कि दिल्ली ले चलो। फिर कहते हैं - दिल्ली में बहुत प्रदूषण है। अभी दिल्ली मत लेकर चलना। जहां हम रह रहे हैं वहां कितना प्रदूषण है। ये प्रदूषण क्यों ज्यादा बढ़ रहा है? पहले क्यों नहीं था? निश्चित रूप से हमें समय के हिसाब से परिवर्तित होना है। मैं बिना प्रेस के कपड़े पहन सकता हूं। इसमें मेरा कोई काम प्रभावित नहीं हो रहा है। अगर व्यक्ति छोटे-छोटे बदलाव करता गया तो ये बदलाव एक क्रांतिकारी बदलाव हो जाएगा। सवाल: इससे बिजली की कितनी बचत होगी? जवाब: प्रेस करने में आधा यूनिट बिजली खर्च होती है। इस तरह हफ्तेभर में सात जोड़ी कपड़े प्रेस करने में अगर साढ़े तीन-चार यूनिट बिजली खर्च होती है तो एक महीने में करीब 15 से 20 यूनिट बिजली खर्च होगी। इसका 12 महीने का हिसाब लगाया जाए तो 240 यूनिट बिजली खर्च होगी। 240 यूनिट बिजली से 410 ग्राम कार्बन डाइऑक्साइड पैदा होगी। इस तरह सालभर यदि बिना प्रेस किए हुए कपड़े पहनूंगा तो कुछ अंश में ही लेकिन प्रदूषण को कम करने में योगदान दूंगा। ऐसे अगर 100 लोगों ने फैसला किया तो अंतर आने लगेगा। अगर हमने कंट्रोल नहीं किया तो वो दिन न आ जाए कि हमारे नौनिहाल अपनी पीठ पर ऑक्सीजन सिलेंडर लेकर घूमेंगे। सवाल: क्या आप पैंट-शर्ट भी पहनते हैं? जवाब:मैं आम तौर पर कुर्ता-पजामा ही पहनता हूं। लंबे समय से यही पहन रहा हूं। अब जो भी पहनूं, एक साल के लिए संकल्प लिया है कि बिना प्रेस के ही पहनूंगा। मुझे तो किसी ने नहीं कहा था आप बिना प्रेस किए कपड़े पहनो। ये निर्णय खुद का है तो इसका पालन भी हमें ही करना है। सवाल: फ्रिज, एसी से भी कार्बन का उत्सर्जन होता है? जवाब: ये भौतिकवाद युग हो गया है। उतना उपयोग करें, जितना मानव जीवन के लिए जरूरी है। जैसे कुछ देर अगर हम गर्मी में बिना एसी के बैठ जाएंगे तो क्या नुकसान हो जाएगा। बैठ सकते हैं तो वो काम हमें करना चाहिए। मीटिंग में जाना है और जल्दी जाना है तो गाड़ी का उपयोग करें, लेकिन मेरे पास पर्याप्त समय है तो मैं साइकिल का उपयोग क्यों नहीं कर सकता। कई लोग देश में कर रहे हैं। सवाल: नेताओं के घर तो बहुत बिजली की खपत है?जवाब: मेरे निजी निवास ग्वालियर में भी सौर ऊर्जा की प्लेट लगी है। मंत्री आवास में भी सोलर की प्लेट लगी है। ये इसलिए कि हम ग्रीन एनर्जी पैदा करने का संदेश दें। हमारी सरकार भी यही कर रही है। सवाल: ज्योतिरादित्य सिंधिया आपकी प्रेरणा है, क्या उन्हें भी ऐसा करना चाहिए?जवाब: मैंने सिंधिया जी को बहुत नजदीक से देखा है। कई बार आपने उनके हाथों में झाड़ू देखी होगी। वो कई प्रेरणादायी काम खुद ही करते हैं। वो तो हम लोगों को मार्गदर्शन देते हैं।",

            "description": "UPDATE 4-Judge temporarily blocks Trump's use of wartime powers to target Venezuelan gang members A federal judge on Saturday temporarily blocked any deportations that would occur under President Donald Trump's invocation of a little-used wartime law to expedite the expulsion of alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Trump invoked earlier in the day the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 against the group saying the country was facing an \"invasion\" from a criminal organization that has been linked to kidnapping, extortion, organized crime and contract killings.Hours afterwards, Judge James Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order for 14 days. Boasberg said the act \"does not provide a basis for the president's proclamation given that the terms invasion, predatory incursion really relate to hostile acts perpetrated by any nation and commensurate to war.\" In invoking the act, Trump said members of the gang were \"conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States\" with the goal of destabilizing the nation.The act, which has only been used in times of war, could allow the president to bypass the due process rights of migrants categorized as threats and rapidly deport them. While the proclamation was released by the White House on Saturday, the wording suggests Trump signed it on Friday.\"This proclamation is as lawless as anything the Trump administration has done,\" Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, who argued for the order in a hearing on Saturday, told Reuters in an interview. \"We are on very dangerous ground when the administration is going to try to use wartime authority, when we're at peace, for immigration purposes or any other-non military purpose.\"Under Trump's proclamation, all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are determined to be members of the gang, are within the United States, and are not naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the country are \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.\" The Alien Enemies Act is best known for its use to justify internment camps for people of Japanese, German and Italian descent during World War Two.Civil rights groups and some Democrats have criticized the idea of reviving it to fuel mass deportations and the move will likely trigger legal challenges. The Trump administration in February designated Tren de Aragua, the Sinaloa Cartel and six other criminal groups as global terrorist organizations.Saturday's directive said that Tren de Aragua \"has engaged in and continues to engage in mass illegal migration to the United States to further its objectives of harming United States citizens.\" LAWSUITS AND CRITICISMTrump made the threat posed by the gang a regular feature of his campaign speeches as evidence of what he called a spike in \"migrant crime.\" Numerous studies show immigrants do not commit crimes at higher rates than native-born Americans. Immigration advocacy groups and Democrats ripped Trump's decision.\"Invoking the Alien Enemies Act, an extraordinary wartime power with a shameful history, to arbitrarily detain and deport immigrants is bigoted, dangerous, and profoundly unjust,\" said New York Attorney General Letitia James. William Vasquez, a immigration lawyer in North Carolina, posted on social media that this is the first time the act \"has been applied against migrants from a country with which the U.S. is not at war.\"Trump's action after Boasberg earlier on Saturday temporarily blocked the U.S. government from deporting five Venezuelans after two non-profit groups sued saying invocation of the act would be illegal as it has only been \"a power invoked in a time of war, and plainly only applies to warlike actions.\" The court granted a temporary restraining order, stopping the government from deporting them for 14 days. The American Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups that brought the suit, said the Venezuelans are seeking asylum and have been misidentified as being part of Tren de Aragua.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Court papers show the government has appealed the judge's first temporary restraining order. Trump, a Republican, returned to the White House on January 20 vowing to deport millions of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. But Trump's initial deportations have lagged behind those of his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, who faced high levels of illegal immigration and rapidly deported many recent border crossers.Trump has taken an array of actions to step up immigration enforcement, sending additional troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and reassigning federal agents to help track down immigration offenders. But his administration has had to contend with backed-up immigration courts and limited detention space.",
