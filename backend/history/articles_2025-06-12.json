            "description": "Ayurveda: India's Soft Power Revolution The Union Minister of State for AYUSH and Health and Family Welfare, Prataprao Jadhav, has hailed Ayurveda as 'India's soft power', underscoring its global acceptance backed by modern medical research. His comments were part of a statement at a documentary launch.The film, titled 'Ayurveda, The Double Helix of Life', made its debut at the Film Division Theatre in Delhi. Minister Jadhav attributed its growing popularity to efforts initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in establishing the AYUSH Ministry, emphasizing Ayurveda's peak in global recognition.Directed by Vinod Mankara and produced by Dr. AV Anoop, the documentary aims to dispel misconceptions about Ayurveda by correlating traditional knowledge with scientific research. It showcases over 1,000 peer-reviewed studies and clinical trials, delivering evidence to support Ayurveda's efficacy in modern healthcare.",

            "description": "If you’re looking for a versatile new wireless controller that isn’t exclusive to a particular platform, 8BitDo’s various pads are always worth considering. And Amazon’s current deal on the brand’s Ultimate 2C Wireless Controller is nearly the cheapest we’ve seen. Right now, if you pick up the controller in either its Purple or Green colorways, you’ll pay $25.49, as opposed to $30 or above (the special edition Black Wukong version costs $35) for the other available colors. The lowest price we’ve ever seen this model at is $25. If you’re a console gamer you’ll need to look elsewhere, but the Ultimate 2C plays nice with Android devices and Windows PCs, connecting either via Bluetooth in the case of the former, or over 2.4G or a wired connection for PC. There’s also a mode switch button to make it easy to hop between devices. The controller offers extra bumpers that sit next to the standard left and right bumpers, and these can be remapped without the need for additional software, while the Hall Effect joysticks are precise and reassuringly durable. The Ultimate 2C is compatible with devices running Windows 10 and above, and Android 9.0 or above. You can expect 32 hours of playtime over a Bluetooth connection, or 19 hours when using the wireless 2.4G adapter.

            "description": "Tragedy in the Skies: Air India Crash Claims Lives Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde underscored the gravity of the Air India plane crash, declaring that both the Centre and State governments are committed to addressing the incident effectively. In light of the substantial number of passengers from Maharashtra, a dedicated helpdesk has been established to provide updates to relatives.Shinde also relayed the condolences of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who, along with Union Home Minister Amit Shah, is en route to the accident site. The crash involved an Air India flight operating from Ahmedabad to London, tragically concluding in the Meghaninagar area, near Ahmedabad Airport, on Thursday.Air India's official statement confirmed that the affected flight, AI171, was a Boeing 787-8 craft carrying 242 passengers, including a mix of Indian, British, Canadian, and Portuguese nationals. The flight, steered by experienced Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, encountered a mayday situation, with no subsequent communication received before it crashed beyond the airport perimeter amid visible plumes of black smoke.",

There are the standbys like tools for the grill or a new history book, but there are also plenty of unique options out there. That includes digital options like a Nintendo Switch Online membership or a subscription to MasterClass. A MasterClass subscription is one of our favorite gifts for teachers, but it's also an especially good option right now as the site is running a Father's Day sale. Currently, you can gift dad a one-year membership for up to 50 percent off. Take the MasterClass Plus subscription, which is down to $96 from $180 annually. It offers unlimited classes and access on two devices. Then there's the Premium tier, which allows unlimited access across six devices. The sale brings this option down to $120 from $240 for the year. The cheapest option is the Standard subscription, which is also discounted, and it offers one class every three months on one device.

            "description": "India's Covid-19 Case Load Reaches 7,154; Three New Deaths ReportedNew Delhi, June 12 (UNI) – India’s cumulative Covid-19 case count has risen to 7,154 as of 8 AM on Thursday, according to the latest update from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.33 New Cases in 24 Hours; West Bengal Data PendingIn the last 24 hours, 33 new Covid-19 cases have been confirmed. However, officials noted that updated figures from West Bengal are still awaited, which may affect the final tally for the day.Three More Deaths Reported, Total Death Toll in 2025 Reaches 77Three Covid-related deaths were recorded during the same period—one in Madhya Pradesh and two in Maharashtra—bringing the total number of Covid deaths in 2025 to 77.Recoveries Cross 9,000 Mark This YearMore than 9,000 individuals have successfully recovered from Covid-19 so far in 2025, a positive sign even as daily case numbers continue to fluctuate in certain regions.Kerala Tops the List of Active CasesKerala continues to report the highest number of active cases, with 2,165 infections as of Thursday. Other states with significant active case counts include:Gujarat: 1,281West Bengal: 747Delhi: 731Maharashtra: 615These figures are based on data from the national Covid-19 dashboard.Omicron Sub-Variants Behind the Current SurgeHealth authorities have identified several new Omicron sub-variants — including JN.1, NB.1.8.1, LF.7, and XFC — as the primary drivers of the recent uptick. These variants are believed to be more transmissible but are causing relatively milder illness compared to previous strains.The World Health Organization (WHO) has categorized these strains as “Variants Under Monitoring,” signaling that while they are not immediately concerning, their spread will be closely observed.Covid-19 Now Shows Seasonal Trends Like FluExperts say that Covid-19 has now entered a seasonal phase, similar to influenza. Although no longer classified as a global emergency, the virus still poses risks—particularly to the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions.Health officials continue to urge the public to remain vigilant, practice hygiene, and seek medical attention if symptoms emerge.",

The aircraft, carrying 242 passengers, is believed to have struck the airport boundary wall before crashing inside the airport premises. The crash occurred adjacent to Meghani Nagar, a densely populated residential area close to the airport. While exact details are still awaited, preliminary reports suggest a potentially high number of casualties. Emergency services are at the scene, and rescue operations are currently underway. All roads leading to the airport have been sealed off, and only emergency vehicles are being permitted access. Witnesses say a massive plume of smoke is visible from several kilometers away, spreading panic across the city. Air India has confirmed the incident. Authorities are urging the public to remain calm and avoid spreading unverified information until an official statement is released. As investigations continue, the cause of the crash remains unknown. More updates are expected shortly from aviation officials and the airline.",

            "description": "मेरठ के भावनपुर थाना क्षेत्र में एक दर्दनाक घटना सामने आई है। गौतमबुद्ध नगर से गर्मियों की छुट्टी में नानी के घर आई 2 साल की मासूम शिवि की कार की चपेट में आने से मौत हो गई। घटना गुरुवार सुबह की है। हसनपुर कदीम निवासी सोहन पाल सिंह की पोती शिवि अपनी मां के साथ मायके आई थी। सुबह वह घर के सामने खेल रही थी। इसी दौरान गांव का रहने वाला सुनील तेज रफ्तार में महिंद्रा कार लेकर आया। आरोप है कि वह शराब के नशे में था। कार की टक्कर से शिवि गंभीर रूप से घायल हो गई। स्थानीय लोग तुरंत बच्ची को अस्पताल ले गए। चिकित्सकों ने उसे मृत घोषित कर दिया। घटना के बाद पीड़ित परिवार जब आरोपी के घर पहुंचा तो उनके साथ मारपीट की गई। इससे गांव में तनाव का माहौल बन गया। भावनपुर थाना प्रभारी ने बताया कि मामले में तहरीर मिल गई है। पुलिस ने शव को पोस्टमार्टम के लिए भेज दिया है। मामले की जांच कर निष्पक्ष कार्रवाई की जाएगी।",

            "description": "अंतरराष्ट्रीय कूटनीति की शतरंजी विसात पर भारत ने अमेरिका को जो पटखनी दर पटखनी दी है, उसकी खुन्नस अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप के चेहरे पर साफ महसूस की जा सकती है। वहीं, भारत के सम्बन्ध में उनकी बदलती नीतियों से अब यह स्पष्ट परिलक्षित हो रहा है कि रूस और भारत के संयुक्त चक्रब्यूह में निरंतर फंसते जा रहे अमेरिका के पास अब चीन के समक्ष घुटने टेकने के अलावा और कोई चारा भी नहीं बचा है। लेकिन आप यह जानकर और भी हैरत में पड़ जाएंगे कि इसके बाद भी अमेरिका की दुश्वारियां कम नहीं होने वाली हैं। ऐसा इसलिए की तेजी से वैश्विक महाशक्ति बनते जा रहे भारत ने अंतरराष्ट्रीय दुनियादारी में अमेरिका, चीन और रूस तथा इनके शागिर्द देशों/गठबंधन भागीदारों को साधते हुए खुद को आगे बढ़ाने का जो निश्चय किया है, उससे अमेरिका और चीन के होश फाख्ता हो चुके हैं।इसे भी पढ़ें: आतंकवाद और पाकिस्तान- चीन से दो टूक बात करने का समय आ गयावहीं, भारत का सदाबहार दोस्त रूस मन ही मन गदगद है, क्योंकि अमेरिका और नाटो देशों के खिलाफ जो चक्रब्यूह 15 देशों का समूह सोवियत संघ या उसका बचा हुआ सर्वाधिक शक्तिशाली धड़ा रूस आज तक नहीं रच पाया, उसे भारत ने महाभारत कालीन चक्रब्यूह विधा की तर्ज पर ऐसा रचा की, उसमें फंसकर अमेरिका और यूरोपीय संघ दोनों चिग्घाड़ मार मार कर बचाओ बचाओ की आवाज लगा रहे हैं।इधर, भारत के लिए परेशानियों का सबब बनते जा रहे चीन के खिलाफ भी भारत ने ऐसा चक्रब्युह रचा है कि देर सबेर उसमें उलझकर वह बर्बाद हो जाएगा। इसके लिए भारत ताइवान, तिब्बत और उन मध्य एशियाई देशों जो सोवियत संघ से जुड़े थे, के साथ समझदारी भरे आतंकवाद विरोधी रिश्ते प्रगाढ़ कर रहा है।उधर, अरब और यूरोप में अपनी स्थिति मजबूत बनाने के लिए भारत ने रूस का सहयोग लिया और इस विशाल भूभाग पर अमेरिका और चीन दोनों को कूटनीतिक पटखनी देने का जो निश्चय किया है, उससे देर-सबेर दिल्ली-मास्को एक्सप्रेस वे की आधारशिला तैयार हो जाएगी।इधर, अफ्रीका और दक्षिण अमेरिका में भी भारत अपनी स्थिति निरंतर मजबूत बना रहा है। अमेरिका के पड़ोसी देश कनाडा को भी वह देर सबेर काबू में कर लेगा, क्योंकि वहां पर पंजाबी लॉबी काफी मजबूत है।ऐसे में अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप अमेरिका, चीन और रूस के बीच पूरी दुनिया को साम्राज्यवादी लिहाज से बांटने की जो डील करने वाले हैं, उसकी तैयारी में भारत सबसे बड़ा बाधक बन रहा है। जबकि कारोबारी से राष्ट्रपति बने ट्रंप ने अपनी योजनात्मक किताब में तीनों महाशक्तियों के बीच 3 ही पावर सेंटर्स होने की बात कही है और इसमें भारत के लिए कोई जगह नहीं है।इस क्रम में अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति ट्रंप शायद यह भूल रहे हैं कि जिस ग्रेट ब्रिटेन से उन्होंने दुनिया की बादशाहत मिलकर छीनी है, अब वही यूरोपीय संघ की आड़ में अपना पुराना हिसाब किताब अमेरिका से चुकता करेगा। उसके इस मिशन में फ्रांस और इटली भी उसका साथ देंगे।इधर, प्रथम विश्व युद्ध और द्वितीय विश्व युद्ध का मुख्य खलनायक रहा जर्मनी एक बार फिर रूस के खिलाफ मुखर होकर तीसरा विश्व युद्ध करवाने पर आमादा है। वहीं रूस के सहयोगी चीन, उत्तर कोरिया, ईरान जैसे देश आपसी समझदारी से जो कुछ कर रहे है, उससे अरब का संघर्षभूमि बनना स्वाभाविक है। इसके बाद अमेरिका के सहयोगी जापान, ऑस्ट्रेलिया, इजरायल, सऊदी अरब की भी परेशानी बढ़ेगी। देखा जाए तो साम्राज्यवादी नजरिए से अमेरिका-चीन-रूस, रूस-चीन-अमेरिका, चीन-रूस-अमेरिका के अलावा समय समय पर रूस-चीन-भारत, अमेरिका-चीन-भारत, अमेरिका-रूस-भारत आदि के जो साम्राज्यवादी चक्रब्यूह तैयार किये गए, उसमें से किसी में भारत नहीं फंसा। क्योंकि कुल मिलाकर भारत ही एक मात्र ऐसा देश है जो गुटनिरपेक्ष है। उसका दोस्त रूस भी उसकी गुटनिरपेक्षता में मददगार साबित हुआ है। ऐसे में चाहे अमेरिका-यूरोप गठबंधन हो या रूसी यूरेशिया-चीन-अरब गठबंधन, इनके बीच महायुद्ध होना स्वाभाविक है। ऐसे में गुटनिरपेक्ष भारत का महत्व बढ़ेगा।वहीं भारत ने रणनीतिक लिहाज से रूस-यूक्रेन युद्ध और अमेरिका संरक्षित इजरायल-फिलिस्तीन युद्ध से दूरी बनाकर रखी है। वह चीन-ताइवान युद्ध शुरू होने का इंतजार कर रहा है। इसी बीच अमेरिका-चीन ने भारत को पाकिस्तान से भिड़ाने की जो साजिश रची, उसको भी भारत ने अपने पक्ष में मोड़ लिया। इससे अमेरिका-चीन की जहां कलई खुली, वहीं रूस के साथ हमारे रिश्ते और प्रगाढ़ हुए।भारत और इजरायल की समझदारी भी किसी से छिपी हुई नहीं है। यदि ग्रेटर इजरायल और ग्रेटर इंडिया का स्वप्न साकार हुआ तो दोनों मजबूत पड़ोसी बन जाएंगे। उधर ग्रेटर रूस बनने से वह भी हमारा पड़ोसी बन जाएगा। इससे अमेरिका व चीन के लिए यूरोप और एशिया में कोई जगह नहीं बचेगी, जबकि रूस का एक छत्र राज बढ़ेगा।यही वजह है कि डोनाल्ड ट्रंप बौखलाए हुए हैं। जिस तरह से उन्होंने अपने सहयोगियों के साथ दगाबाजी की है, उसी तरह से उनके सहयोगी भी अब उनसे दगाबाजी कर रहे हैं। यही वजह है कि ट्रंफ ने अपने सहयोगियों की आलोचना की है और दुनिया भर से अमेरिकी सैनिकों को वापस बुलाने की बात की है। स्वाभाविक है कि इससे रूस और चीन को फायदा होगा, जो यूरोप और एशिया में अमेरिकी सुरक्षा के खिलाफ ही सालों से काम करते आए हैं। यही वजह है ट्रंप की परिवर्तित नीतियों से सबसे ज्यादा डर अमेरिका के सहयोगियों में है।बता दें कि कारोबारी से राष्ट्रपति बने डोनाल्ड ट्रंप के लिए सबसे प्यारा शब्द डील है। खासकर यदि बात चीन, रूस और भारत की हो तो अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति और ज्यादा खुलकर सामने आ जाते हैं। दरअसल चीन, रूस और भारत से डील कर ट्रंप अपने अमेरिका में एक बड़ा संदेश देना चाहते हैं। वह यह कि वो उन नेताओें से डील कर सकते हैं, जिन्हें निगोसिएशन के टेबल पर लाना सबसे मुश्किल काम है। बता दें कि एक अमेरिकी अखबार में छपी एक रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, डोनाल्ड ट्रंप ने कहा है कि वे रूस के साथ व्यापार को सामान्य करना चाहते हैं। इससे ऐसा लग रहा है कि वे यूक्रेन के साथ युद्ध को सुलझाने के लिए मॉस्को पर दबाव कम करने का ऑफर दे रहे हैं। इसके साथ ही, वे चीन के नेता से फोन करने का आग्रह करके अपने वैश्विक व्यापार पर पड़ रहे छाया युद्ध के प्रभाव को कम करने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं। वहीं, एक अन्य अमेरिकी मैग्जीन को दिए एक साक्षात्कार में ट्रंप ने दो टूक कहा है कि \"हम सभी डील करना चाहते हैं। क्योंकि मैं यानी अमेरिका एक विशाल स्टोर है। यह एक सुंदर स्टोर है जहां हर कोई यानी प्रत्येक देश खरीदारी करना चाहता है।\"ऐसे में अमेरिकी अखबार का कहना है कि ट्रंप के दिमाग में रूस, चीन और भारत को लेकर कुछ और भी बड़ा हो सकता है। तब यह एक बहुत बड़ी डील होगी। लेकिन कुछ विदेश नीति विश्लेषकों का कहना है कि उनके कार्यों और बयानों से पता चलता है कि वे एक ऐसी दुनिया की कल्पना कर रहे हैं, जिसमें सिर्फ तीन ही बड़ी ताकतें हैं- संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिका, चीन और रूस। इन्हें मिलकर भारत का शोषण करना चाहिए। अमेरिका उन्हें रास्ता दिखाएगा और उनके घाटे को लाभ में बदल देगा। कहने का तातपर्य यह कि ट्रंप ने पूरी पृथ्वी का तीन हिस्सों में बंटवारा कर दिया है, जिसमें पावर सेंटर्स अमेरिका, चीन और रूस हैं। इसमें तेजी से उभरते भारत के लिए उन्होंने कोई जगह नहीं छोड़ी है, जो रूस और चीन के खिलाफभारत को भड़काने की उनकी नई साजिश हो सकती है। क्योंकि अमेरिका, जापान, ऑस्ट्रेलिया और भारत के क्वाड का कबाड़ा तो उन्होंने खुद पुनः पाकिस्तान का साथ देकर निकाल दिया है।कूटनीतिज्ञ बताते हैं कि यह सबकुछ 19वीं सदी की साम्राज्यवादी शासन शैली की तरह ही होगा। क्योंकि ट्रंप ने डेनमार्क से ग्रीनलैंड छीनने और कनाडा को अमेरिका में मिलाने की बात कही है। वो पनामा नहर को फिर से अमेरिकी कंट्रोल में लाने की भी अपनी योजना की घोषणा वो कर चुके हैं। इस प्रकार से उनकी यह सोच 19वीं सदी की साम्राज्यवादी रणनीतियों की तरह है, जब यूरोपीय ताकतों ने अफ्रीका और एशिया को 'स्पीयर ऑफ इन्फ्लुएंस' के तहत बांट लिया था। आपने गौर किया होगा कि डोनाल्ड ट्रंप अक्सर रूस के राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन और चीन के नेता शी जिनपिंग को मजबूत और बुद्धिमान व्यक्ति बताते हैं और उन्हें अपना करीबी दोस्त कहते हैं। कुछ ऐसा ही वो भारत के प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी के बारे में भी कहा करते थे। लेकिन तीनों देशों के साथ वो कैसे छल करते हैं, यह भी दुनिया देख चुकी है।एक तरफ ट्रंफ यूक्रेन से उसकी दुर्लभ खनिज संपदा छीनना चाहते हैं, जिसके लिए वह यूक्रेन के विभाजन का समर्थन कर रहे हैं और नाटो की आलोचना कर रहे हैं। कुछ इसी गरज से ट्रंप ने पुतिन से पिछले हफ्ते दो घंटे तक फोन पर यूक्रेन के बारे में बात की। ततपश्चात सोशल मीडिया पर लिखा कि \"बातचीत का लहजा और भावना बहुत अच्छी थी।\"यदि अंतरराष्ट्रीय विद्वानों की मानें तो \"प्रभाव के क्षेत्रों पर नियंत्रण और विस्तार करना भव्यता की एक फीकी पड़ती भावना को बहाल करता है।\" इसलिए आपको बता दें कि 'प्रभाव के क्षेत्र' शब्द की उत्पत्ति 1884-85 के बर्लिन सम्मेलन में हुई थी, जिसमें यूरोपीय शक्तियों ने अफ्रीका को विभाजित करने की एक औपचारिक योजना को अपनाया था। यही वजह है कि भारत के मजबूती भरे परमार्थी रवैये से इतर अमेरिका, रूस और चीन के नेता \"एक ऐसे अतीत की ओर देख रहे हैं, जो ज्यादा मुक्त और गौरवशाली था।\" ऐसे में उनका मानना है कि ‘स्पीयर ऑफ इन्फ्लुएंस’ की सोच, खो चुके महाशक्तिशाली युग को दोबारा जीवित करने की लालसा को दर्शाती है।ऐसे में स्वाभाविक सवाल है कि ट्रंप की विदेश नीति में उनका 21वीं सदी का पार्टनर भारत कहां है? शायद कहीं नहीं, क्योंकि उसने रूस के प्रति वफादारी नहीं छोड़ी है। इसलिए अब अमेरिका की पश्चिमी गोलार्ध में अपने प्रभाव के क्षेत्र का विस्तार करने की इच्छा है। वहीं ट्रंप प्रशासन के कई पूर्व अधिकारी मानते हैं कि ट्रंप की विदेश नीति तात्कालिक और व्यक्तिनिष्ठ होती है, न कि कोई वैश्विक रणनीति बनाई जाती है। फिर भी हालात बताते हैं कि ट्रंप और उनके कुछ सहयोगी दुनिया को साम्राज्यवादी दृष्टिकोण से देखने लगे हैं। लेकिन साम्राज्यवादी युग के बाद प्रभाव का क्षेत्र स्थापित करना आसान नहीं है, यहां तक कि एक महाशक्ति के लिए भी। यही वजह है कि ट्रंप ने यूक्रेन के बाद ताइवान और पाकिस्तान को लेकर आशंका पैदा कर दी है। ऐसा इसलिए कि चीनी विश्लेषक साफ बताते हैं कि \"बीजिंग तो अमेरिका के साथ प्रभाव क्षेत्रों को लेकर एक बड़े सौदे की इच्छा रखता है और इसका पहला लक्ष्य ताइवान ही होगा।” लिहाजा यह सवाल उठ रहे हैं कि क्या ट्रंप आगे जाकर ताइवान को लेकर सौदा तो नहीं कर लेंगे?शायद रूस के साथ भी यूक्रेन को लेकर भी कुछ ऐसा ही कर सकते हैं। लेकिन कश्मीर और पाकिस्तान को लेकर वह भारत के प्रति उदार नहीं हैं।यही वजह है कि ट्रंप की यह नई सोच अमेरिकी विदेश नीति को न सिर्फ यूरोप बल्कि एशिया में भी अस्थिर बना सकती है। इससे चीन और रूस को भी नए सिरे से हिम्मत मिलेगी। संभव है कि ट्रंप की ये विचारधारा आने वाले महीनों में अंतरराष्ट्रीय मंच पर भूचाल ला सकती है। यही वजह है कि अब अमेरिकी मीडिया में भी यह कहा जाने लगा है भारत के साथ ट्रंप जिस तरह का व्यवहार कर रहे हैं, वो अमेरिका की विदेश नीति के लिए बेहद घातक हो सकता है। बताया जाता है कि उनके पूर्ववर्ती बाइडेन प्रशासन ने भारत को इंडो-पैसिफिक में अहम साझेदार की तरह देखा, लेकिन ट्रंप की बदलती हुई नीतियां उसके खिलाफ हैं, जिससे अमेरिकी एक्सपर्ट्स ने अब यह कहना शुरू कर दिया है कि अमेरिका, एशिया में भारत जैसा अपना मजबूत पार्टनर खो सकता है। जाहिर तौर पर इसका नुकसान आने वाले वक्त में अमेरिका को ही चुकाना होगा।वहीं, बदलते वैश्विक हालात को समझते हुए रूस के विदेश मंत्री सर्गेई लावरोव ने सोमवार (9 जून, 2025) को भारत और चीन के रिश्ते पर बड़ी बात कहते हुए स्पष्ट किया कि, \"उनको लगता है कि दोनों देशों के बीच तनाव काफी कम हो गया है इसलिए आरआईसी (RIC) यानी रूस-इंडिया-चाइना के बीच त्रिकोणीय सहयोग बनाने का अच्छा मौका है।\" सर्गेई लावरोव ने कहा कि आरआईसी त्रिकोणीय सहयोग का रुका हुआ काम फिर से शुरू हो सकता है।उल्लेखनीय है कि साल 2020 के गलवन घाटी हमले के बाद भारत और चीन के रिश्तों में काफी तनाव आ गया था, जो इस साल 2025 की शुरुआत में कम होने लगा था, लेकिन भारत और पाकिस्तान की ताजा लड़ाई में चीन ने जो रुख अपनाया है, उसकी वजह से एक बार फिर दूरियां बढ़ गई हैं। मई माह में पाकिस्तान और भारत के बीच चली 3-4 दिन की लड़ाई के दौरान भले ही चीन ने सामने आकर पाकिस्तान का सहयोग न किया हो, लेकिन 10 मई को जैसे ही दोनों देशों के बीच सीजफायर हुआ तो चीनी विदेश मंत्री वांग यी ने पाकिस्तान के सपोर्ट में बयान दिया।उन्होंने कहा कि क्षेत्रीय अखंडता, संप्रभुता और राष्ट्रीय स्वतंत्रता को बनाए रखने के लिए हमेशा पाकिस्तान के साथ खड़ा रहेगा। इसके अलावा, चीन पाकिस्तान को हथियारों का सबसे बड़ा सप्लायर है, जिनका इस्तेमाल लड़ाई के दौरान भारत के खिलाफ किया गया। हालांकि, भारत की ताकत के सामने ये हथियार कुछ कर नहीं सके। यही वजह है कि अब रूसी विदेश मंत्री को लगता है कि भारत और चीन के बीच तनाव कम हो रहा है।मॉस्को में 'भविष्य-2050 के फोरम’ को संबोधित करते हुए सर्गेई लावरोव ने कहा कि आरआईसी प्रारूप में संयुक्त कार्य की बहाली बहुध्रुवीय वास्तुशिल्प के निर्माण समेत यूरेशियाई प्रक्रियाओं की दिशा में पहला कदम हो सकता है। रूसी समाचार एजेंसी तास के अनुसार लावरोव ने कहा, 'मुझे वाकई उम्मीद है कि हम रूस-भारत-चीन त्रिकोण के काम को फिर से शुरू कर पाएंगे। पिछले कुछ सालों से हमारी विदेश मंत्रियों के स्तर पर बैठक नहीं हुई है लेकिन हम अपने चीनी सहयोगी और विदेश विभाग के भारतीय प्रमुख के साथ इस मुद्दे पर चर्चा कर रहे हैं।'उन्होंने कहा, 'मैं वास्तव में आशा करता हूं कि अब जब तनाव कम हो गया है, मेरी राय में, भारत और चीन के बीच सीमा पर काफी हद तक कम हो गया है और स्थिति स्थिर हो रही है तो ऐसे में नई दिल्ली और बीजिंग के बीच बातचीत हो रही है, तो हम इस रूस-भारत-चीन त्रिकोण के काम को फिर से शुरू करने में सक्षम होंगे।'पिछले सप्ताह, एक पाकिस्तानी प्रतिनिधिमंडल ने मॉस्को में लावरोव से मुलाकात की थी और रूसी राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन के लिए प्रधानमंत्री शहबाज शरीफ का एक पत्र सौंपा। रूसी विदेश मंत्रालय के हवाले से समाचार एजेंसी ने बताया कि लावरोव ने कहा कि दोनों देशों के बीच आपसी विश्वास बनाने के लिए पाकिस्तान और भारत के बीच सीधी बातचीत की आवश्यकता है।अंतरराष्ट्रीय कूटनीतिज्ञ भी बताते हैं कि भारत, एक नहीं बल्कि कई गठबंधन में शामिल है भी और नहीं भी! वह चीन और अमेरिका विरोधी विभिन्न त्रिगुट, चतुर्गुट या गठबंधन में है भी और नहीं भी! कहना न होगा कि विगत 11 वर्षों में अंतरराष्ट्रीय कूटनीतिक संतुलन का जो कीर्तिमान भारत ने स्थापित किया है, उसपर उसके अलावा किसी अन्य देश के चलने की उम्मीद भी नहीं की जा सकती है। इसलिए वैश्विक दुनियादारी में भारत का भविष्य उज्ज्वल है। वह सबको साथ लेकर चलने की क्षमता रखता है। यही वजह है कि उसकी आर्थिक और सैन्य शक्ति लगातार बढ़ रही है। अमेरिका, चीन व अरब देशों की घबराहट की वजह भी यही है।- कमलेश पांडेयवरिष्ठ पत्रकार व राजनीतिक विश्लेषक",

            "description": "छत्तीसगढ़ में बुधवार को कोविड के 5 नए मरीज मिले हैं। इनमें रायपुर से 3 और बिलासपुर से 2 मरीज हैं। प्रदेश में अब कुल कोविड केसेस का काउंट 69 हो गई है। इनमें से 21 रिकवर हो चुके हैं। वहीं 45 एक्टिव हैं। इनमें 41 होम आइसोलेशन में हैं। 3 ऑक्सीजन सपोर्ट में हैं, वहीं 1 मरीज ICU में हैं। पिछले 4 दिनों की बात करें तो कोविड के कुल 25 मरीज मिले हैं। इस महीने कोविड के सबसे ज्यादा मरीज बीते शुक्रवार को यानी 6 मई को मिले थे। एक ही दिन में रायपुर में 11, बिलासपुर में 5 और बालोद में 1 कुल 17 मरीज मिले थे। नया वैरिएंट आने के बाद से ये एक दिन में सबसे बड़ा आंकड़ा था। इसके बाद पूरा प्रशासन हाई अलर्ट मोड पर आ गया है। शासकीय जिला अस्पतालों और दूसरे हेल्थ सेंटर्स में टेक्निकल और नॉन-टेक्निकल सभी तरह के स्टाफ की ट्रेनिंग भी शुरू कर दी गई है। सैंपल कलेक्शन से लेकर कोविड मरीज के इलाज तक की ट्रेनिंग स्टाफ को दी जा रही है। साथ ही एमरजेंसी सिच्युएशन से निपटने के लिए मॉकड्रिल भी कराई गई है। ओवर ऑल बात करें तो प्रदेश में अब तक रायपुर, दुर्ग, बिलासपुर, बालोद, बस्तर और बेमेतरा कुल छह जिलों में कोविड के पेशेंट मिल चुके हैं। फिलहाल, स्वास्थ्य विभाग कोविड JN.1 को लेकर अलर्ट पर है। मेकाहारा के डॉ. आर के पांडा के मुताबिक, ज्यादातर मरीज होम क्वारैंटाइन में ही ठीक हो जा रहे हैं, लेकिन उन मरीजों को ज्यादा खतरा है, जिन्हें पहले से दूसरी या एक से ज्यादा बीमारियां हैं। खासकर डायबिटीज पेशेंट और चेन स्मोकर्स नए वैरिएंट के चपेट में जल्दी आ सकते हैं। देशभर में कोविड से 51 मौतें वहीं, अगर देशभर की बात करें तो 9 राज्यों को छोड़कर बाकी स्टेट्स में कोविड का नया वैरिएंट JN.1 फैल चुका है। अब तक 6 हजार 491 मरीज मिल चुके हैं, जबकि 65 मौतें हो चुकी हैं। वहीं 6 हजार 861 मरीज ठीक हो चुके हैं। एक्सपर्ट का कहना है कि नया वैरिएंट पहले की तुलना में कम खतरनाक हैं, फैटेलिटी रेट सिर्फ 2% है। मेकाहारा में कोविड के सीरियस केस अब तक नहीं आए मेकाहारा में पल्मोनरी मेडिसिन डिपार्टमेंट के हेड आर के पांडा ने बताया कि कोविड के सीरियस केस अब तक नहीं आए हैं। मेकाहारा में 28 मई से कोविड ओपीडी शुरू कर दी गई है। कोविड का लक्षण दिखने पर तत्काल मरीजों की स्क्रीनिंग की जा रही है। मेकाहारा में अब तक 45 लोगों का RTPCR टेस्ट मेकाहारा में अब तक 45 से अधिक लोगों का RTPCR टेस्ट किया गया है। हालांकि पिछले कुछ दिनों में आंकड़े बढ़े हैं। स्वास्थ्यकर्मियों को कोविड पेशेंट के इलाज के लिए ट्रेनिंग दी जा रही है। इसके अलावा 15 बेड वाला कोरोना ICU रेडी रखा है। DKS में स्पेशल एडवाइजरी नहीं वहीं DKS के डिप्टी सुपरिटेंडेंट हेमंत शर्मा ने बताया कि उन्हें कोविड को लेकर कोई स्पेशल एडवाइजरी नहीं मिली है। इसकी वजह से ये व्यवस्था शुरू नहीं हो पाई है। यहां कोविड टेस्ट नहीं हो रहा है। ऑक्सीजन प्लांट्स बंद, बिगड़ सकती व्यवस्था रायपुर में कोविड के बढ़ते केस के बीच सबसे बड़ी समस्या ऑक्सीजन प्लांट को लेकर दिखती है। लास्ट कोविड वेव के दौरान पीएम केयर फंड से सरकारी अस्पताल DKS, आयुर्वेदिक कॉलेज और अंबेडकर अस्पताल में अपना ऑक्सीजन प्लांट खड़ा किया गया था, जिससे मरीजों को वक्त पर सप्लाई मिल सके। अस्पताल परिसर में लगे ये ऑक्सीजन प्लांट बंद पड़े हैं। DKS में बीते 2 सालों में अस्पताल ने ऑक्सीजन सिलेंडर पर करीब 3.84 करोड़ रुपए खर्च कर दिए। हर महीने करीब 16 लाख रुपए का बिल सिर्फ सिलेंडर खरीदने में जा रहा है। डिमांड पूरी नहीं कर पाएंगे अभी के प्लांट्स- DKS वहीं हमें DKS के डिप्टी सुपरिटेंडेंट हेमंत ने बताया कि CGMSC की ओर से उन्हें लिक्विड ऑक्सीजन प्लांट के लिए एनओसी नहीं मिली। DKS में अभी CGMSC की ओर से एक ऑक्सीजन प्लांट ऑपरेट हो रहा हैं, जिसकी कैपेसिटी 900 लीटर प्रति मिनट ऑक्सीजन जनरेट करनी की है। उन्होंने बताया कि ये प्लांट इस समय हॉस्पिटल की सिर्फ 60% डिमांड ही पूरी कर पा रहा है। बाकी 40% सिलेंडर हॉस्पिटल को प्राइवेट एजेंसी से बुलाने पड़ रहे हैं। ऐसे में कोविड केसेस अचानक बढ़ने पर ऑक्सीजन की डिमांड सरकारी सिस्टम फिलहाल पूरी करने की स्थिति में नहीं दिखता। ऐसे में लोगों को प्राइवेट सिलेंडर लेने होंगे। जिसके 1 जम्बो सिलेंडर की कीमत 300 से 400 के बीच होगी। एक सिलेंडर लगभग 4-5 मिनट ही चल पाता है। कोविड पॉजिटिव पेशेंट्स की ट्रैवल हिस्ट्री नहीं प्रदेश में बुधवार को कोविड के 4 नए मरीज मिले थे। इनमें से 3 मरीज रायपुर और एक बिलासपुर से हैं। इससे पहले पिछले 2 दिनों में 7 नए एक्टिव केस आइडेंटिफाई किए गए थे। इनमें से किसी की कोई ट्रैवल हिस्ट्री नहीं थी। 13 में से 12 मरीजों को होम क्वारैंटाइन किया गया है। वहीं एक का निजी हॉस्पिटल में इलाज चल रहा है। सर्दी-खांसी के मरीज लगातार बढ़ रहे- स्वास्थ्य विभाग छत्तीसगढ़ स्वास्थ्य विभाग के मुताबिक सर्दी-खांसी के मरीज बढ़ रहे हैं। इन्फ्लुएंजा लाइक इलनेस (इली) और सीवियर एक्यूट रेस्पिरेटरी इलनेस (सारी) के लक्षण जिस भी मरीज में दिखे। उनके संबंध में तत्काल इंटीग्रेटेड हेल्थ इन्फॉर्मेशन सेंटर में रिपोर्ट करें। वहीं, इस कंडीशन में दी जाने वाली दवाइयों से जो मरीज ठीक हो, उनकी स्क्रीनिंग की जाए। तत्काल उनके सैंपल कोविड-19 जांच के लिए भेजा जाए। जीनोम सीक्वेंसिंग के सैंपल एम्स भेजे जाएंगे स्वास्थ्य विभाग के मुताबिक जरूरत पड़े तो जीनोम सीक्वेंसिंग के सैंपल एम्स, रायपुर भी भेजे जा सकते हैं। वहीं मितानिनों के माध्यम से समुदाय स्तर पर ऐसे लक्षणों की रिपोर्टिंग सुनिश्चित करने पर जोर दिया गया है। इसके साथ ही अस्पतालों में जरूरी दवाइयों और सुरक्षा उपकरणों की उपलब्धता सुनिश्चित करने के निर्देश दिए गए हैं। ........................... कोरोना से जुड़ी ये खबर भी पढ़ें... नया कोविड वैरिएंट स्मोकर्स-डायबिटीज पेशेंट के लिए खतरनाक: छत्तीसगढ़

            "description": "From dusty village corners to buzzing digital labs, India’s skilling movement has found new energy. Over the past year, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, under the steady guidance of Minister Jayant Chaudhary, has quietly rewritten the story of India’s workforce—empowering over 1.5 crore people with skills that matter.This momentum didn’t happen overnight. It has been built through a mix of policy reform, industry partnerships, and deep community outreach. Take the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY 4.0)—over 1.63 crore youth have been trained, many in future-ready sectors like electronics, logistics, and healthcare. Likewise, the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) has placed more than 8.7 lakh apprentices across 1.5 lakh businesses, reflecting a strong push toward practical, on-the-job learning.A key strength of this movement has been the rising participation of women. Through the Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) scheme, over 5.05 lakh individuals have been trained—80% of them women. From tailoring and beauty services to digital skills, women across India are stepping into the workforce with growing confidence and capability.To make apprenticeships more attractive, the government approved a 36% hike in stipends, now ranging from ₹6,800 to ₹12,300 per month, with adjustments every two years based on inflation. This practical support is helping reduce dropouts and making apprenticeships a more viable choice—especially for those from low-income households.The transformation goes beyond individuals—it extends to institutions. Traditional ITIs are being upgraded with smart classrooms and updated curricula. A major leap came with the ₹60,000 crore National Scheme for ITI Upgradation, which will modernise 1,000 ITIs and establish five National Centres of Excellence. These are being designed to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving job market.A big part of this shift is also digital. The Skill India Digital Hub (SIDH) has emerged as a powerful platform—over 1 crore users and 50 lakh course completions—offering skills in AI, drone technology, cloud computing, and more. The portal is now integrated with flagship schemes like PM Vishwakarma, JSS, and even Green Hydrogen training, bringing high-tech learning to the remotest parts of the country.SIDH is also driving trust and transparency in certification. New NCVET-certified digital credentials now include QR codes, NSQF levels, photographs, and secure signatories—making certificates easier to verify and more useful for employers. The onboarding of JSS institutions onto SIDH using mobile OTP and Aadhaar e-KYC has made registration simple and scalable.On the ground, the energy is visible at events like Kaushal Mahotsavs in Bijnor and Bharatpur. With 17,000+ registrations and 3,000+ placements on the spot, these events are not just about employment—they’re about creating hope at scale.At a policy level, more doors are being opened. The Model Skill Loan Scheme was relaunched with a higher credit cap—₹7.5 lakh, up from ₹1.5 lakh—and now includes NBFCs and non-NSQF courses, allowing more youth to access high-quality training, even from private institutes.Minister Jayant Chaudhary’s commitment to industry alignment has also strengthened public-private partnerships. Under PMKVY 4.0, collaborations with Air India SATS, Flipkart, and Swiggy are enabling co-pay skilling with guaranteed placements. And to future-proof this ecosystem, 8,000 new trainers are being trained under ToT programmes with HAL, ICT Academy, and NAC.Institutional development continues apace. Two Indian Institutes of Skills (IIS)—in Mumbai and Ahmedabad—have begun operations, with the first batches graduated in October 2024. Another 200 ITIs are being upgraded as Centres of Excellence, with 800 more in a spoke-hub model. Pilot programmes like the AI Programming Assistant, now running in 19 NSTIs, offer a glimpse into tomorrow’s skill landscape.India’s skill development efforts are also gaining global recognition. Renewed MoUs with Germany and Singapore, and the Ministry’s presence at the World Economic Forum in Davos, highlight India's increasing role in shaping the future of global workforce standards. One standout partnership is with Microsoft—the AI Careers for Women initiative will train 20,000 women in Tier II and Tier III towns, blending innovation with inclusion.Across all these achievements, a quiet but clear narrative emerges—this isn’t just a year of activity; it marks the beginning of long-term transformation. Minister Jayant Chaudhary’s inclusive and reform-driven leadership has focused on making skills more accessible, market-relevant, and future-ready.From policy reform to digital innovation, and from women-led progress to global collaboration, the Ministry’s work is no longer just about training—it’s about changing lives. And the journey, it seems, has only just begun.",

            "description": "Mexico City, June 12 (IANS) Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has said that people \"must always keep a cool head\" when dealing with the United States and \"always value everything in its proper context\" after a senior American official said she \"encouraged\" migrant protests in Los Angeles, California.During her daily morning press conference at the National Palace on Wednesday (Mexico time), the Mexican president denied that she or the ruling National Regeneration Movement (Morena) is encouraging the violent protests, an accusation levelled by US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and the political opposition in Mexico.Sheinbaum said statements she made three weeks ago about peacefully opposing a US bid to tax remittances were taken out of context, reports Xinhua news agency.\"We have never called for a violent demonstration, never in our entire lives,\" said Sheinbaum.At a White House event on Tuesday, Noem said, \"Claudia Sheinbaum came out and encouraged more protests in LA, and I condemn her for that.\"US immigration raids at schools and businesses and mass deportations of undocumented migrants sparked sometimes violent protests in Los Angeles that appeared to escalate after the White House decided to deploy troops to quell the unrest. Many people have been arrested.\"Yesterday, when the Secretary of Homeland Security made this statement, we immediately said: absolutely false, totally false. We have never called for the (violent) actions in Los Angeles,\" Sheinbaum said.The president also chided political opposition figures in Mexico who took to social media to repeat the accusations against her and the Morena party.It \"is their right\" to disagree, said Sheinbaum, but \"the problem is that they are trying to create, fraudulently, a problem between the United States and Mexico, and that is unpatriotic.\"Some 61 Mexicans have been arrested in connection with the protests in Los Angeles, she said, adding the government's position is to always defend the rights of Mexicans at home or abroad.\"First, we will always defend Mexicans. Second, we must always act responsibly, with a cool head, in our relationship with the United States. And third, the role that all Mexicans should be playing is defending our fellow citizens who are experiencing a difficult relationship\" in the United States, Sheinbaum said.Finally, the president said she would make the case at a meeting later in the day with US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau that Mexicans residing in the United States are hardworking people who deserve recognition that the US economy needs their labour.--IANSint/sd/(Disclaimer: This report has been published as part of the auto-generated syndicate wire feed.

            "description": "Kilauea Volcano's Majestic Dance: An Ongoing Eruption Kilauea, renowned as one of the world's most dynamic volcanoes, rekindled its fiery display on Wednesday as lava burst from its north vent on Hawaii's Big Island. This marked the latest chapter in an eruption saga that kicked off nearly half a year ago.Spectacular lava fountains soared beyond 330 feet, fueling a web of fiery streams. The US Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory reported that even higher fountains could emerge.The eruption was heralded by Tuesday's gas-pistoning, with gas accumulating at a lava column top within a vent. This led to repeated lava surface risings and splatter, increasing in frequency until a sustained dome fountain developed, feeding flows into the crater floor by Wednesday.",
