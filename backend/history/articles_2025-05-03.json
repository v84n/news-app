This system is designed to engage aerial targets effectively, both day and night, even in adverse weather conditions such as snow-bound environments.The Ministry of Defence has issued a request for proposal (RFP) seeking prospective bidders to supply 48 launchers, 48 night-vision sights, 85 missiles, and a missile test station. The procurement is part of a strategic move to bolster the Army's air defence capabilities against evolving dynamic air threats.Developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation, the VSHORADS is a man-portable system praised for its 'fire-and-forget' missile technology. The system is capable of defending against fighter jets, helicopters, and unmanned aerial systems across various terrains and will be employed by all three branches of India's armed forces.",

            "description": "Water Wars: Haryana Urges Central Intervention in Dispute with Punjab In the wake of mounting tensions over water distribution between neighboring states, Jannayak Janta Party leader Dushyant Chautala has appealed to the central government for immediate intervention. Chautala condemned the Aam Aadmi Party and highlighted the need for Haryana, Delhi, and Rajasthan to receive their rightful share of water, even suggesting the use of force.This appeal follows an all-party meeting convened in Haryana by the BJP, in response to Punjab's refusal to adhere to the Bhakra Beas Management Board's decision on water allocation. Haryana Chief Minister expressed concerns over the state's ongoing water shortage, reiterating the need for fair resource distribution.Meanwhile, Punjab's Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann raised alarms over diminishing water levels in key dams, stressing the state's own water needs. As tensions simmer, the call for federal oversight grows louder, with regional leaders seeking to prevent a full-blown crisis amid critical water shortages.",

            "description": "Vikrant Massey was part of a panel discussion titled The Changing Face of Indian Cinema at the ongoing WAVES 2025 in Mumbai. Sharing the stage with filmmaker Om Raut, actress Sonali Kulkarni, and actor Ravi Mohan, Massey offered a grounded perspective on why small-town narratives are resonating more deeply with audiences today.Reflecting on the shift in storytelling patterns within Hindi cinema, the 12th Fail actor pointed to changing audience preferences, exposure to global content, and a move toward realism. “Cinema, a few years ago, was an experience for a layman—to see machismo, larger than life, one man beating up 20 people. We all have grown up watching it, and we still watch it. But a large chunk also goes to our exposure to international cinema and a certain sense of pragmatism even in storytelling,” he said.Massey credited earlier films like Dum Laga Ke Haisha for paving the way, while acknowledging how the so-called \"alternative\" genre has now entered the mainstream. “Today, what I feel is that what was alternative 15 years ago is mainstream today. I can never imagine a film like 12th Fail or Trapped to be commercially successful back then,” he noted. He also highlighted how relatability plays a key role in the rise of such narratives. “Most of the people I have met here have told me ‘Thank you for 12th Fail, this is our story.’ When they see themselves or someone alike on the screens, there is a sense of hope which is still there within us,” he said.In addition to audience-driven change, Massey brought attention to the practical aspects that encourage filmmakers to explore small-town settings—particularly government incentives. “Why are most of us also moving to smaller towns? Because of subsidies. Very straightforward answer this is! Jo state sarkaar hame achchi subsidy deti hai, achcha infrastructure deti hai, hum wahin jaate hai,” he said candidly. The actor cited Uttar Pradesh as an example, where the film policy provides a single-window clearance system and strong logistical support.He added that cities like Delhi are now developing their own ecosystems: “Earlier, there was only one industry in Mumbai; now even Delhi has an industry. You will get all the equipment in Delhi, and overnight it will reach Lucknow.”Quoting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent statement at the summit, Massey concluded, “In a nation of more than 140 crore, we have more than 100 crore stories, and we are tapping into those smaller stories, bigger stories, larger-than-life stories. I think it is just the beginning.”Vikrant Massey is now gearing up for the release of Aankhon Ki Gustaakhiyan, which also marks the debut of Shanaya Kapoor. The film is slated to release in July this year.Also Read: WAVES 2025: Kareena Kapoor Khan recalls Steven Spielberg recognising her from 3 Idiots; says, “I didn’t need to act in an English film for him to see me”",

            "description": "The anthology Bombay Talkies completed 12 years today. The film had four short segments out of which one was Murabba. Directed by Anurag Kashyap, it starred Viineet Kumar Siingh in the lead. On the film’s anniversary, Viineet spoke about the film in an interview with us.Bombay Talkies has completed 12 years. Your performance in the omnibus is still talked aboutI am so happy. I did not even realize that 12 years have gone by. It was a very good experience in Bombay Talkies. The story in which I worked was Murabba. The character's name was Vijay and it was amazing. It was about the task given by the father of that character played by Sudhir Pandeyji, ‘You go and feed the murabba to the superstar of the century Amitabh Bachchan sir and then my health will be fine.’ That boy, my character Vijay comes to Mumbai from Prayagraj to feed the jam to Amitabh Bachchan sir with his own hands.Your character had a brilliant graphYes, in that whole process the way a character evolves in Mumbai, from coming to feeding the jam and back... In the journey between leaving and reaching his father back home, he understands life. He understands that he was living in some other world and perhaps this was his father's intention that his son should evolve and understand life on his own. So, in the whole effort and struggle to feed Bachchan saab a murabba, he saw and lived so much of life that it would be useful to him throughout his life.Did the story help you evolve?That story was very useful to me as an actor. I had a lot of fun and I consider myself fortunate because I was part of film for the celebration and tribute to 100 years of Indian cinema. Bombay Talkies was made for this purpose and four very good directors directed four stories - Karan Johar sir, Zoya Akhtar, Dibakar Banerjee and Anurag Kashyap sir. I got to work with Anurag sir. This character Vijay was something new for me, sir. It was something that I am not in my personal life and most of the scenes were improvised, meaning they were hardly written in four pages.You shot most of the film outside Mr Bachchan’s bungalowIt literally used to happen impromptu. The guards outside Bachchan sahab's bungalow were also not informed and I was left alone to behave like a fan. A random talk would start, then the guards would be told about the purpose of my visit. It seemed as if someone has actually come who insists on feeding Bachchan sir jam, so that entire scene is the first take, so even the guards did not know that this was going to happen and it was planned, so that the scene kept getting improvised and all the scenes that came after that also kept being improvised, talking to a random taxi driver, talking to a random stranger, asking him, so there are a lot of moments like this in that film.So much improvisation must have helped you evolve as an actorIt helped me a lot as an actor; now improvising feels like it makes the process of acting beautiful, that some things are planned and some things are unplanned. And when both are mixed it becomes beautiful. So, it was a very good experience and that story is liked and even now people send its clips, some of its clips keep going viral every now and then, so I am so happy today. 12 years have been completed and thank you so much sir. Thank you, it is a big thing that you remembered me for this thing. It is a big thing for an artist to do some work and if the connoisseurs remember that character, then it is a happiness which lasts a lifetime. The money that we earn while working gets spent but this appreciation keeps increasing with time, so that's the beauty of good work. Thank you so much sir. I want to share one more thing.Tell me?Working with Amitabh Bachchan sir, sharing the screen is in itself every actor's dream. Before that, before Bombay Talkies, in 2005, I had done Viruddh as an assistant director, so I was on the floor with Bachchan sir for about 55-60 days. I was an AD, so after some eight years, when the time for screen sharing with him came, it seemed that whatever happens in life, it's happening for a reason. One more thing was special for me: Rajeev Ravi who is the cameraman, this was my second film with Rajiv sir. Before this, I had worked with Rajiv sir in Gangs of Wasseypur. Murabba was shot in a different way, mostly as I told you, things were being improvised, random things were happening. I did not even know from where the camera would capture me. All this was a lot of new learning experience for me.Also Read: Dibakar Banerjee on 12 Years of Bombay Talkies, “It all started with my hero Satyajit Ray”",

            "description": "Indian cricket superstar Virat Kohli found himself at the centre of a social media storm after his verified Instagram account liked a photo posted by a fan page dedicated to Bollywood actress Avneet Kaur. The incident, which sparked widespread speculation and a flurry of memes, prompted the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) batter to issue a public clarification on May 2, 2025, stating that the interaction was unintentional and caused by an algorithmic error.On May 2, Kohli took to his Instagram Stories to address the speculation, stating, “I’d like to clarify that while clearing my feed, it appears the algorithm may have mistakenly registered an interaction. There was absolutely no intent behind it. I request that no unnecessary assumptions be made. Thank you for your understanding.” The like was subsequently removed from the post, but the clarification did little to quell the online frenzy, with fans continuing to share humorous takes and some questioning the plausibility of an algorithmic error.The controversy began on April 30, when a fan page for Avneet Kaur shared a series of bold photos of the 24-year-old actress from her recent trip to Goa, featuring her in a stylish green crop top and printed wrap skirt. On May 1, eagle-eyed netizens noticed Kohli’s username among the post’s likes, leading to a cascade of reactions online. The timing of the incident, coinciding with Kohli’s heartfelt birthday post for his wife, actress Anushka Sharma, fuelled further chatter, with some users questioning the cricketer’s intentions and others flooding comment sections with humorous remarks.Screenshots of the like circulated rapidly, with fans tagging Anushka Sharma and even Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, demanding accountability for what some believed was a technical glitch.Also Read: Neeti Mohan shares unseen photo of Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli from their daughter Vamika’s birthday celebration",

This decision, announced by the commerce ministry, follows a tragic terror attack in Pahalgam, which claimed 26 lives.According to the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2023, the new provision restricts the import or transit of all goods originating in or exported from Pakistan until further notice. The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) formalized this order, emphasizing its importance for public policy.Any exceptions to this import prohibition will require explicit approval from the Government of India. This move is seen as a strategic measure to strengthen national security and public safety.",

            "description": "धार्मिक शहर उज्जैन में मोबाइल पर रील देखने और गेम खेलने की लत छुड़ाने के लिए अब लोग भगवान का सहारा ले रहे हैं। चिंतामन मंदिर परिसर में स्थित विघ्नहर्ता गणेश मंदिर में बच्चों की बुरी लत छुड़ाने के लिए पुजारी संकल्प दिला रहे हैं। खास बात ये है कि कई बच्चे यहां संकल्प लेने के बाद मोबाइल पर गेम खेलने की आदत छोड़ भी चुके हैं। दरअसल नशे की तरह ही बच्चे मोबाइल के आदी होते जा रहे हैं। इसका बुरा असर उनके व्यवहार पर पड़ने लगा है। माता-पिता ने जरा सी जिद करने पर जिस मोबाइल को खिलौना समझ बच्चों को थमाया था, अब वही उनके लिए तनाव का कारण बनता जा रहा है। मोबाइल की लत से दूर रखने के लिए तरह-तरह के जतन के बीच भगवान का सहारा लिया जा रहा है, अभिभावक बच्चों को मोबाइल से दूर रखने के लिए पढ़ाई और खेल में व्यस्त कर रहे हैं, तो इस बीच धार्मिक उपाय भी कर रहे हैं। उज्जैन शहर से करीब 6 किमी दूर प्रसिद्ध चिंतामन गणेश मंदिर परिसर में लक्ष्मण बावड़ी के पास स्थित विघ्नहर्ता गणेश मंदिर में बच्चे मोबाइल की लत छुड़ाने के लिए संकल्प ले रहे हैं। मंदिर के पुजारी ईश्वर शर्मा ने बताया कि कई लोग इस मंदिर में अपनी मुराद लेकर आते थे, लेकिन कुछ समय से लोगों ने मुझे कहा कि हमारे बच्चे को मोबाइल की लत है और वो छोड़ता नहीं है। जिसके बाद हमने बच्चों को संकल्प दिलाना शुरू किया, कुछ दिन बाद उन्हीं अभिभावकों ने फोन पर मुझे बताया कि आपके संकल्प ने मोबाइल पर गेम खेलना और दिन भर मोबाइल पर रील देखना बंद कर दिया है। अब तक करीब 200 बच्चों का मोबाइल संकल्प से छुड़वा चुका हूं। ऐसे होता है संकल्प- पुजारी ईश्वर शर्मा ने बताया कि हम तो सिर्फ मंदिर में लक्ष्मण बावड़ी के समीप विराजमान विघ्नहर्ता गणेश के सामने बच्चों को बैठाते हैं, उसी से संकल्प दोहराते हैं फिर ये मूषक के कान में अच्छे से पढ़ाई की बात बुलवाते हैं। कई माता-पिता बच्चों को तीन से पांच बुधवार लेकर आ रहे हैं और संकल्प करवा रहे हैं। यहां आने पर बच्चों में ये विकृति में कमी आ रही है, जो अभिभावक बच्चों को लेकर मंदिर आते हैं उनको भगवान गणेश के सामने खड़े कर संकल्प दिलवाते हैं जो इस प्रकार है। \"हे विघ्नहर्ता हमको अच्छी बुद्धि देना, विद्या देना, मैं मम्मी-पापा दादा-दादी और नाना-नानी सहित सभी बड़ों की बात मानूंगा। मैं जिद नहीं करूंगा, मैं मोबाइल पर गेम नहीं खेलूंगा, बड़ों की बात सुनूंगा।\" ऐसे शुरू हुआ सिलसिला- पुजारी ईश्वर शर्मा बताते हैं कि देशभर से श्रद्धालु मंदिर में भगवान गणेश का आशीर्वाद लेने के लिए आते हैं। यहां आने वाले कुछ लोग दर्शन करते समय अपने बच्चों को मोबाइल से दूर रखने की बात करते थे। , तभी से लगा की मंदिर में बच्चों को मोबाइल से दूर रहने का संकल्प दिलवाना चाहिए और करीब एक साल से ये परम्परा चल निकली और जिन लोगों को पता चलता है और जो बच्चों को मोबाइल से दूर रखना चाहते हैं वो अभिभावक अपने बच्चों को लेकर मंदिर पहुंच जाते हैं। मनोचिकित्सक बोले धार्मिक भावना जोड़कर लत छुड़ाने का अच्छा प्रयास- मनोचिकित्सक डॉ. पराग ढोबले ने बताया कि 20 प्रतिशत अभिभावक बच्चों की मोबाइल संबंधी लत को लेकर आ रहे हैं। अधिकांश बच्चे मोबाइल पर ऑनलाइन गेम के ज्यादा एडिक्ट हो रहे हैं। मनोवैज्ञानिक तरीके से ऐसे बच्चों का इलाज कर रहे हैं। धार्मिक स्तर पर भी बच्चों को मोबाइल से दूर रखने के लिए उन्हें मोटिवेट किया जा रहा है, यह भी एक अच्छा प्रयास है। देशभर से श्रद्धालु मंदिर में दर्शन के लिए आते हैं- मंदिर की मान्यता है कि त्रेता युग में 14 वर्ष के वनवास के दौरान भगवान राम, लक्ष्मण और सीता ने उज्जैन के शिप्रा नदी किनारे राम घाट पर दशरथ जी का पिंडदान किया और उसके बाद दक्षिण दिशा में चलते हुए मंदिर के पास आकर वटवृक्ष के नीचे आराम कर ही रहे थे कि सीता मैया को पूजन करने का मन किया इस दौरान वटवृक्ष के पास भगवान चिंतामन, इच्छामन और सिद्धिविनायक की मूर्ति देख उन्होंने प्रथम पूजन इस मंदिर में किया था। हालांकि इस दौरान जलाभिषेक करने के लिए जब उन्हें जल नहीं मिला तो लक्ष्मण जी अपने बाण से मंदिर के सामने ही बाणगंगा के रूप में जल को पाताल से जमीन पर ले आए थे तभी से यहां पर बावड़ी का नाम बाणगंगा और लक्ष्मण बावड़ी रखा गया था। इसी बावड़ी के पास विराजित है विघ्नहर्ता गणेश मंदिर।",
