            "description": "Originally appeared on E! OnlineNo job is too small for Geoffrey Owens.That’s why “The Cosby Show” alum returned to work at Trader Joe’s after he was job-shamed by online critics in 2018.“Trader Joe’s was a wonderful job,” he said in a recent interview with V-103 Atlanta’s “Big Tigger Morning Show.” “I’ve gone back there since all happened. And basically, I asked for hours to work there again.”While Owens didn’t specify if he is still an employee at the grocery store, he did share insight into why he initially left his post amid “scrutiny” over his day job.“I’m a very private person,” he explained. “It wasn’t like I quit knowing that I was going to be making a lot of money soon or anything. I just felt like I wasn’t going to be able to handle that kind of attack on my privacy.”But the 63-year-old has no problem working for an honest pay. After all, as he put it, his residual checks from “The Cosby Show” were “never particularly wonderful.”READ Cosby Show Star Geoffrey Owens Speaks Out After Being Job-Shamed“I did maybe 20 percent of the show,” he noted. “People have a false you impression of what the average middle class actor makes and their ability to make a living in the industry. That’s what drove me to work at Trader Joe’s to begin with.”Owens continued, “But honestly, I’m not much better off now.”In fact, the actor — whose recent credits include “Poppa’s House” and “Mr. Santa: A Christmas Extravaganza” — said he’s still dealing with financial hardships.“Even today, right now, as we speak, I still struggle to make a living,” he shared. “I struggle every day to make my ends meet. And people can’t get their heads around that because they see me in movies.”Still, Owens is “not complaining” about his situation.“I’m grateful for the work I have,” he added. “I work more than a lot of people do, so I got to keep perspective.”",

            "description": "दौसा जिले में मौसम का मिजाज पूरी तरह बदल गया है। बीते कई दिनों से आसमान में बादल छाने और सर्द हवाओं के दौर के बाद शुक्रवार दोपहर से ही जिले के कई इलाकों में हल्की बारिश का दौर जारी है। यहां सुबह से ही सूर्य के बादलों की ओट में छिपे होने से धूप नहीं निकली तो वहीं दोपहर से सर्द हवाओं ने जोर पकड़ लिया। इसके बाद दौसा जिला मुख्यालय समेत बांदीकुई, सिकराय, महवा व लालसोट इलाके में हल्की बारिश हुई। शाम को कई जगह मध्यम तो कहीं तेज बारिश हुई। पौष माह में होने वाली बारिश को फसलों के लिए अमृत समान माना गया है। ऐसे में मावठ होने से सरसों, चना व गेहूं समेत अन्य फसलों को फायदा होगा। किसानों का कहना है कि मावठ से तो फसलों को फायदा तो होगा, लेकिन सर्द हवाओं से अगेती फसलों में नुकसान की आशंका भी बनी हुई है। ऐसे में यदि अच्छी बारिश होने के बाद मौसम साफ होता है या फिर कोहरे का असर रहता है तो फसलों की ग्रोथ अच्छी होगी। वहीं दूसरी ओर बारिश और सर्द हवाओं के दौर के बीच तापमान में भी लगातार गिरावट दर्ज की जा रही है। शुक्रवार को न्यूनतम तापमान 15 डिग्री और अधिकतम तापमान 20 डिग्री सेल्सियस रहा। जबकि शनिवार को न्यूनतम तापमान 5 डिग्री सेल्सियस की गिरावट के साथ 10 डिग्री सेल्सियस रहने का अनुमान है। साथ ही अधिकतम तापमान भी स्थिर बना रह सकता है। ऐसे में सर्दी का असर बढ़ेगा।",

            "description": "The Dearness Allowance (DA) for state government employees remains uncertain. However, a DA increase for central government employees in January is almost certain, with speculation rife about the percentage. The central government increases the DA for its employees twice a year, in January and July. The central government increased DA by 3% during Diwali. Currently, central employees receive 53% DA. Speculation is rife about when the central government will announce the next DA increase, typically twice a year, in January and July. The DA increase is effective from January to June and from July to December. Speculation has begun on the DA increase percentage for the new year, following a 3% increase in October. Reports suggest the AICPI index reached 144.5 by October, potentially leading to a 55.05% DA increase. If the index reaches 145.3 by December, a 56% DA increase is possible in January 2025. The central government has not made any official announcement yet. A 3% DA increase would mean a Rs 540 raise for employees with a basic salary of Rs 18,000 and Rs 270 for pensioners receiving Rs 9,000. With current minimum/maximum salaries at Rs 18,000/Rs 250,000 and pensions at Rs 9,000/Rs 125,000, a 3% DA hike translates to a Rs 7,500/Rs 3,750 increase respectively.",

            "description": "कर्मचारी निकाय महासंघ ने नागरिकों के लिए जन्म-मृत्यु प्रमाण पत्र प्राप्त करने की प्रक्रिया को सरल बनाने की मांग की है। महासंघ के अध्यक्ष शशि मिश्रा ने कहा कि वर्तमान में जन्म और मृत्यु प्रमाण पत्र जटिल और महंगी प्रक्रिया बन चुकी है। इसके लिए उन्होंने मुख्यमंत्री को पत्र लिखा है। केंद्र सरकार की देखरेख में सिविल रजिस्ट्रेशन सिस्टम पोर्टल के माध्यम से ऑनलाइन प्रमाण पत्र जारी किए जाते हैं। हालांकि यदि जन्म और मृत्यु का पंजीकरण एक साल के भीतर नहीं कराया जाता तो नागरिकों को नगर मजिस्ट्रेट और एसडीएम कोर्ट में शपथपत्र के साथ दस्तावेजों के साथ आवेदन करना पड़ता है। इस प्रक्रिया में तहसीलदार और लेखपाल द्वारा जांच की जाती है। इसके बाद संबंधित आदेश ऑनलाइन जारी होते हैं। इसके बावजूद इस पूरी प्रक्रिया में महीनों लग जाते हैं और कम से कम 2000 रुपए का खर्च आता है। महासंघ का कहना है कि इस प्रक्रिया में भारी बोझ और भ्रष्टाचार की संभावना है। इससे आम नागरिकों को काफी परेशानी होती है। उनका कहना है कि यदि इस प्रक्रिया को सरल और सुलभ बनाया जाए तो नागरिकों को इस महत्वपूर्ण प्रमाण पत्र को प्राप्त करने में कठिनाइयों का सामना नहीं करना पड़ेगा। महासंघ ने मुख्यमंत्री से इस मामले में हस्तक्षेप करने की अपील की है। इस प्रक्रिया को सरल, पारदर्शी और कम खर्चीला बनाने के लिए त्वरित कदम उठाए जाने की मांग दोहराई है। महासंघ का कहना है कि यह मुद्दा आम जनता के लिए अत्यंत महत्वपूर्ण है, और उच्च स्तरीय जांच के बाद इसे हल किया जाना चाहिए।",

Married individuals should pay extra attention to their children’s health today, as there may be concerns requiring significant expenses. You might receive unexpected gifts or tokens of appreciation from friends or relatives. The day will be filled with love and affection, though an old issue could spark a disagreement with your partner later in the evening. Students should focus on their studies rather than spending time idly with friends—this is a critical phase for building their future. Taking your partner for granted may lead to misunderstandings, so show appreciation where it's due. A long-awaited phone call could bring back cherished memories and evoke a sense of nostalgia. Remedy: Carry a green handkerchief with you to attract positive energy in your business or professional life.Lucky Colour: White. Auspicious Time: 2 pm to 3 pm.",

            "description": "The Federal Reserve in December projected fewer interest rate cuts for 2025. Yields on high-yield savings accounts, money market funds, certificates of deposit and other cash-like accounts should benefit from this “higher for longer” rate environment.Many people, especially those with debt, will be discouraged by the recent Federal Reserve forecast of a slower pace of interest rate cuts than previously forecast.However, others with money in high-yield cash accounts will benefit from a “higher for longer” regime, experts say.“If you’ve got your money in the right place, 2025 is going to be a good year for savers — much like 2024 was,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.Why higher for longer is the 2025 ‘mantra’Returns on cash holdings are generally correlated with the Fed’s benchmark interest rate. If the Fed raises interest rates, then those for high-yield savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market funds and other types of cash accounts generally rise, too.The Fed increased its benchmark rate aggressively in 2022 and 2023 to rein in high inflation, ultimately bringing borrowing costs from rock-bottom rates to their highest level in more than 22 years. It started throttling them back in September. However, Fed officials projected this month that it would cut rates just twice in 2025 instead of the four it had expected three months earlier.“Higher for longer is the mantra headed into 2025,” McBride said. “The big change since September is explained by notable upward revisions to the Fed’s own inflation projections for 2025.”The good and bad news for consumersThe bad news for consumers is that higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing, said Marguerita Cheng, a certified financial planner and CEO of Blue Ocean Global Wealth in Gaithersburg, Maryland.“[But] higher interest rates can help individuals of all ages and stages build savings and prepare for any emergencies or opportunities that may arise — that’s the good news,” said Cheng, who is a member of CNBC’s Financial Advisor Council.More from Personal Finance:Credit card debt set to hit record levelsMore than 90% of 401(k) plans now offer Roth contributionsWhy the ‘great resignation’ became the ‘great stay’High-yield savings accounts that pay an interest rate between 4% and 5% are “still prevalent,” McBride said.By comparison, top-yielding accounts paid about 0.5% in 2020 and 2021, he said.The story is similar for money market funds, he explained.Money market fund interest rates vary by fund and institution, but top-yielding funds are generally in the 4% to 5% range.However, not all financial institutions pay these rates.The most competitive returns for high-yield savings accounts are from online banks, not the traditional brick-and-mortar shop down the street, which might pay a 0.1% return, for example, McBride said.Things to consider for cashThere are of course some considerations for investors to make.People always question which is better, a high-yield savings account or a CD, Cheng said.“It depends,” she said. “High-yield savings accounts will provide more liquidity and access, but the interest rate isn’t fixed or guaranteed. The interest rate will fluctuate, nor your principal. A CD will provide a fixed guaranteed interest rate, but you give up liquidity and access.”Additionally, some institutions will have minimum deposit requirements to get a certain advertised yield, experts said.Further, not all institutions offering a high-yield savings account are necessarily covered by Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. protections, said McBride. Deposits up to $250,000 are automatically protected at each FDIC-insured bank in the event of a failure.“Make sure you’re sending your money directly to a federally insured bank,” McBride said. “I’d avoid fintech middlemen that rely on third-party partnerships with banks for FDIC insurance.”A recent bankruptcy by one fintech company, Synapse, highlights that “unappreciated risk,” McBride said. Many Synapse customers have been unable to access most or all of their savings.

            "description": "Disney+ Hotstar is thrilled to bring back the much-loved Gunaah with its highly anticipated second season, premiering exclusively from January 3, 2024, onwards. This season takes the intensity up a notch, delving deeper into a gripping tale of revenge, betrayal, and love. With more twists, emotional drama, and shocking revelations, it promises to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Starring Abhimanyu (Gashmeer Mahajani), Tara (Surbhi Jyoti), JK (Darshan Pandya), and Michael (Shashank Ketkar) amongst others, the show releases from January 3, 2024 onwards.Director Anil Senior said, “I’m beyond excited to bring Gunaah Season 2 to our audience. After the overwhelming success of Season 1 on Disney+ Hotstar, we knew we had to raise the stakes even higher. This season isn’t just about revenge and betrayal; it’s about exploring the raw, unfiltered emotions of each character. Their journeys are more complex, and I believe viewers will truly connect with the depth of their struggles. It’s been a thrilling challenge to push the boundaries of storytelling and create an even more intense and immersive experience. I can’t wait for everyone to see what we’ve put together.”Mautik Tolia, Producer and Managing Director at Bodhitree Multimedia, added, “The return of Gunaah with its second season is a reflection of the incredible response and love the audience has given to this series. At Bodhitree Multimedia, we strive to create stories that resonate deeply and Gunaah is no exception. This season delves into the complexities of human relationships, blending intense drama with emotions that are both raw and real. It has been an rewarding journey bringing this story to life and we are thrilled to take audiences on another unforgettable ride.”Surbhi Jyoti, who plays Tara, expressed, “Season 1 introduced everyone to Tara’s world—her struggles, her relationships, and the weight of her choices. But Season 2 is on a whole new level. Tara is thrown into situations that challenge everything she stands for, pushing her strength and emotions to their very limits. The twists in her relationship with Abhimanyu are heart-wrenching and raw, and I think anyone who has ever wrestled with love, guilt, or redemption will deeply connect with her story. I’m so excited for audiences to see this side of her—it’s emotional, intense, and full of surprises!”Gashmeer Mahajani, who plays Abhimanyu, shared, “Abhimanyu’s journey in Gunaah Season 2 is nothing short of extraordinary. This time, his choices are more difficult, his struggles are more profound, and his vulnerabilities are laid bare. It was both challenging and rewarding to portray his evolution, especially as he navigates the tumultuous relationships and high-stakes decisions that define this season. I’m confident that viewers will resonate with the complexities of his character and the emotional depth of his story.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Disney+ Hotstar (@disneyplushotstar)Also Read: Photos: Krishna Shroff, Nimrit Kaur Ahluwalia, Gashmeer Mahajani, Sumona Chakravarti and others attend the Khatron Ke Khiladi 14 event in Mumbai",

            "description": "Ali Fazal made his Bollywood film debut with 3 Idiots (2009) and immediately caught the attention of the industry and fans, despite limited screen time. Ali played the role of Joy Lobo, who dies by suicide after being demotivated by the college dean, played by Boman Irani. His demise forms an important part of the film as it talks about the burning issue of student suicides. Even after 15 years, when reports of students ending their lives emerge, one can’t help but remember Ali Fazal’s track in 3 Idiots, which proves its impact.Bollywood Hungama exclusively spoke to Ali Fazal recently and reminded him that 3 Idiots will complete 15 years on December 25. Ali was stunned by this information. When asked how he looks back at the film, he replied, “It did what it did at that time for me. I thank the makers for it. Vidhu sir (Vidhu Vinod Chopra) is somebody I’d love to come back and work with. I had a small role but he made sure that the soul of that part remains in the film. And it did and it worked. I thank him and Raju sir (Rajkumar Hirani).”3 Idiots also starred Aamir Khan in the lead role. Life came full circle for Ali Fazal as he collaborated with the superstar in Lahore 1947, one of the most awaited films of 2025. On this, he said, “Our bond has been amazing. He has been a great mentor at different stages of my life. I thank him for that. Lahore 1947 has been a wonderful experience.”Ali Fazal also revealed that he hasn’t completed its shoot yet saying, “A few days of the shoot remains. I (couldn’t shoot before as I) got busy with Mani Ratnam sir’s Thug Life.” Directed by Rajkumar Santoshi, Lahore 1947 also stars Sunny Deol and Preity Zinta.In 3 Idiots, Joy Lobo designs a drone camera but since he fails to submit the project on time, he is failed by college director Dr Viru Sahastrabuddhe aka Virus. Hence, Joy is devastated and ends his life. Ali Fazal in recent times was seen in Mirzapur as a dreaded gangster. Hence, a famous internet meme shows Joy telling Virus, “Sir, kabhi Mirzapur mein aake mera drone fek ke dikhao, fir dekho”!When asked Ali Fazal about it, he couldn’t stop laughing and said, “Yeah I have seen it and it is so funny man! Somebody sent it to me while shooting. I love the meme culture. People are quite creative.”Mirzapur, Fukrey updatesMirzapur has become an iconic show and fans are excited to know that Mirzapur The Film is in the offing. Will there be another season of Mirzapur along with the film? Ali Fazal answered, “I believe so but I don’t know about it. What I do know is that we are focusing on the film and plan to get it on floors as soon as the script is looked.”Will he be back in Fukrey 4? He said, “Yes, if it happens. Par ab kitni Fukrey banayenge? (laughs)”. When said that he was missed in the third part and there were whistles for him in the end credit scene, he said, “I know and we did readings as well. I was supposed to do it but then I got busy with Vishal ji’s film, Khufiya (2023). Due to the pandemic, things got pushed. Also, half of my time was devoted to Mirzapur. So, I had to opt out. The makers allowed me as the other stalwarts of the film were there.”Digital release at last for Girls Will Be GirlsMeanwhile, Ali Fazal is happy with the premiere of his first production Girls Will Be Girls on Amazon Prime Video, which he made along with his wife Richa Chadha. Despite being a very Indian story, it made waves in film festivals across the world.He said, “Any story that is rooted in emotions will always make sense anywhere in the world. That is the power of cinema or should I say, the hack of cinema. It’s a great lesson for the scriptwriters that they should stay true to their story and their roots. This is because you know them well. Writer-director Shuchi Talati knows that world well. We have also grown up in the 90s.”Ali continued, “For one of the screenings at Sundance, we just went to see the audience reaction. People were reacting as if they were watching a thriller! People were even relating to cute moments like when the girls tells the guy to cut the call after one ring.”He signed off by saying, “I really thank Amazon for championing this project. It sends the right message to young and offbeat filmmakers that there’s a space for such films.”Also Read: 15 Years of 3 Idiots EXCLUSIVE: Sharman Joshi recalls unexpected fame in China-Hong Kong, thanks to Aamir Khan-starrer: “They recognized me, gave me FREE drinks everywhere!”",

            "description": "Cinema has always mirrored the changing times, evolving alongside societal shifts. Over the years, the way films are made, consumed, and experienced has transformed drastically, with both positive and negative implications. Some industry veterans and actors like Manisha Koirala, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Shriya Pilgaonkar and Kritika Kamra recently shared their thoughts on this evolution in an exclusive interview with Bollywood Hungama, highlighting the contrasts between the past and present.From Lost Poetry to Realism in PerformancesManisha Koirala, nostalgically reflected on what has been lost in modern cinema. She noted, “Music and poetry is missing,” a sentiment many fans of older films might share. “Pehle achhe gaane hote the, thehraav hota tha, abhi woh missing hai”. She added, “Everything is robotic now, we used to be relaxed earlier,” pointing to the more mechanical, fast-paced nature of modern filmmaking.The rise of digital platforms and social media has also altered personal connections. Koirala emphasized, “We had human bondings earlier and today it’s just the feedback through social media,” illustrating the shift from real-world connections to online interactions. Despite these changes, Koirala said, “The pace is good now, I like it,” and expresses, “I love the realism in the performance and takes nowadays.”Changing Dynamics of Personal Connections in CinemaShriya Pilgaonkar mentioned, “Aaj kal log darr gaye hain that we will be misunderstood,” revealing how fear of judgment has impacted modern performances. She also highlighted by saying, “Abhi everyone has their own people and their own circle.” This sentiment is echoed by Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who remarked, “Pehle industry mein bonds bante the, ab no one has time.”Shift Away from Emotional Depth and ConnectionsKritika Kamra observed a troubling trend and said, “Now it is glorification of hustle culture.” The evolution of cinema presents a complex picture. While there are undeniable advances in technology, performance, and storytelling, many lament the loss of the emotional depth and bonds that once defined the industry.Also Read: Manisha Koirala expresses happiness as she reunites with Mani Ratnam at IFFI Goa",

            "description": "People around the world suffered an average of 41 extra days of dangerous heat this year because of human-caused climate change, according to a group of scientists who also said that climate change worsened much of the world’s damaging weather throughout 2024.The analysis from World Weather Attribution and Climate Central researchers comes at the end of a year that shattered climate record after climate record as heat across the globe made 2024 likely to be its hottest ever measured and a slew of other fatal weather events spared few.“The finding is devastating but utterly unsurprising: Climate change did play a role, and often a major role in most of the events we studied, making heat, droughts, tropical cyclones and heavy rainfall more likely and more intense across the world, destroying lives and livelihoods of millions and often uncounted numbers of people,” Friederike Otto, the lead of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College climate scientist, said during a media briefing on the scientists’ findings. “As long as the world keeps burning fossil fuels, this will only get worse.”Millions of people endured stifling heat this year. Northern California and Death Valley baked. Sizzling daytime temperatures scorched Mexico and Central America. Heat endangered already vulnerable children in West Africa. Skyrocketing southern European temperatures forced Greece to close the Acropolis. In South and Southeast Asian countries, heat forced school closures. Earth experienced some of the hottest days ever measured and its hottest-yet summer, with a 13-month heat streak that just barely broke. climate changeSep 18Studies reveal drastic increase in deaths related to extreme heatExtreme WeatherSep 3Extreme heat worsens chronic health conditions in millions of AmericansTo do its heat analysis, the team of volunteer international scientists compared daily temperatures around the globe in 2024 to the temperatures that would have been expected in a world without climate change. The results are not yet peer-reviewed, but researchers use peer-reviewed methods.Some areas saw 150 days or more of extreme heat due to climate change.“The poorest, least developed countries on the planet are the places that are experiencing even higher numbers,” said Kristina Dahl, vice president of climate science at Climate Central. What’s worse, heat-related deaths are often underreported. “People don’t have to die in heat waves. But if we can’t communicate convincingly, ‘but actually a lot of people are dying,’ it’s much harder to raise this awareness,” Otto said. “Heat waves are by far the deadliest extreme event, and they are the extreme events where climate change is a real game changer.”This year was a warning that the planet is getting dangerously close to the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warming limit compared to the pre-industrial average, according to the scientists. Earth is expected to soon edge past that threshold, although it’s not considered to have been breached until that warming is sustained over decades.The researchers closely examined 29 extreme weather events this year that killed at least 3,700 people and displaced millions, and found that 26 of them had clear links to climate change.The El Niño weather pattern, which naturally warms the Pacific Ocean and changes weather around the world, made some of this weather more likely earlier in the year. But the researchers said most of their studies found that climate change played a bigger role than that phenomenon in fueling 2024’s events. Warm ocean waters and warmer air fueled more destructive storms, according to the researchers, while temperatures led to many record-breaking downpours.Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod who wasn’t involved in the research, said the science and findings were sound.“Extreme weather will continue to become more frequent, intense, destructive, costly, and deadly, until we can lower the concentration of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere,” she said.Significantly more climate extremes could be expected without action, the United Nations Environment Programme said in the fall, as more planet-warming carbon dioxide has been sent into the air this year by burning fossil fuels than last year.But the deaths and damages from extreme weather events aren’t inevitable, said Julie Arrighi, director of programmes at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre and part of the research. “Countries can reduce those impacts by preparing for climate change and adapting for climate change, and while the challenges faced by individual countries or systems or places vary around the world, we do see that every country has a role to play,” she said.",

            "description": "श्री कर्ण नरेंद्र कृषि विश्वविद्यालय जोबनेर में मधुमक्खी पालन पर मंथन हुआ। यहां शुक्रवार को विश्वविद्यालय परिसर में हुए कार्यक्रम में अंतर्राष्ट्रीय ख्याति प्राप्त वैज्ञानिक डॉ. डी पी अब्रोल मौजूद रहे। विश्वविद्यालय के कुलपति डॉ. बलराज सिंह ने कार्यक्रम की अध्यक्षता की। महाविद्यालय के 11 विभाग के स्नातकोत्तर और विद्या वाचस्पति के 122 छात्रों के साथ मधुमक्खी पालन की राजस्थान में संभावनाओं‌ व चुनौतियों पर विस्तार से मंथन किया।कार्यक्रम में छात्रों ने मधुमक्खी पालन के क्षेत्र में भविष्य की संभावना व चुनौतियों के पहलुओं पर सवाल जवाब किए । इस दौरान विद्यार्थियों को मधुमक्खी पालन के महत्व, मधुमक्खी की प्रजातियों और शहद की उपयोग को लेकर जानकारी दी गई। विश्वविद्यालय करेगा किसानों के जल्द ही एडवाइजरी एप तैयारकुलपति डॉ. बलराज सिंह ने बताया कि विश्वविद्यालय मधुमक्खी पालकों के लिए जल्द ही एक एडवाइजरी एप लॉन्च करेगा। इस एप के माध्यम से मधुमक्खी पालन से संबंधित सभी जानकारी प्राप्त कर सकेंगे। उन्होंने कहा- इस ऐप में मधुमक्खी पालन की उन्नत तकनीकों और बीमारियों के नियंत्रण संबंधित जानकारी मिलेगी साथ ही यह मोबाइल एप किसानों को मधुमक्खी पालन को ओर अधिक लाभदायक बनाने में मदद करेगा और उन्हें नवीनतम तकनीकों से अवगत कराएगा।मधुमक्खी पालन की संभावनाएंविश्वविद्यालय के अंतर्गत आने वाले 15 जिलों में मधुमक्खी पालन की अपार संभावना देखी है क्योंकि इस क्षेत्र में रेपसीड और सरसों का उत्पादन अधिक होता है। सरसों में मधुमक्खियां 20 - 25 % तक उपज में वृद्धि करती है। राजस्थान में मधुमक्खी पालन केवल शहद उत्पादन तक सीमित नहीं है। इसका उपयोग जैविक खेती, औषधीय उत्पादों और सौंदर्य प्रसाधनों में बढ़ रहा है। वर्तमान में भारत में लगभग 2.5 लाख मधुमक्खी कॉलोनियां हैं, जबकि देश की क्षमता 200 लाख कॉलोनियों तक की है। यह दर्शाता है कि मधुमक्खी पालन के क्षेत्र में अपार संभावनाएं मौजूद हैंमधुमक्खी पालन के व्यवहार को यह कर रहे प्रभावितमधुमक्खी कॉलोनियाँ, जैसे डॉर्साटा, जो आक्रामक होती हैं, जल्दी माइग्रेट कर जाती हैं। इससे बचने के लिए मधुमक्खियों के आसपास डीजे का शोर नहीं करना चाहिए, उनके आसपास धुआं करने से भी बचना चाहिए, क्योंकि यह उनके व्यवहार को प्रभावित कर सकता है। समूह में जोर से बोलने या शोर मचाने से भी मधुमक्खियां भ्रमित हो सकती है साथ ही, भड़किले या उज्जवल रंग के कपड़े पहनने से भी बचना चाहिए, क्योंकि ये कपड़े मधुमक्खियों को आकर्षित कर सकते हैं। मधुमक्खी पालन की चुनौतियांकीटनाशकों का अत्यधिक छिड़काव मधुमक्खी पालन के लिए एक बड़ी चुनौती है, इसके समाधान के लिए जैविक कीटनाशकों का उपयोग एक प्रभावी विकल्प हो सकता है। भरतपुर और अन्य क्षेत्रों में एक हेक्टेयर भूमि में लगभग 1000 मधुमक्खी कॉलोनियों को रखने की प्रवृत्ति देखी जा रही है। इससे मधुमक्खियों के बीच भोजन के लिए प्रतिस्पर्धा बढ़ जाती है। प्रतिस्पर्धा के कारण फूलों पर अधिक दबाव पड़ता है और मधुमक्खियों का मल-त्याग फूलों के स्त्रीकेसर (स्टिग्मा) पर गिर जाता है, जिससे परागण की प्रक्रिया प्रभावित होती है और फसलों की उपज कम हो जाती है।सोलर पैनलों के परावर्तन से मधुमक्खियां भ्रमित हो जाती हैं। यह परावर्तन उनके नेविगेशन सिस्टम को बाधित करता है, जिससे वे अपने छत्ते तक वापस नहीं लौट पातीं। कई बार मधुमक्खियां इन पैनलों से टकराकर मर जाती हैं, जिससे उनकी संख्या में कमी आती है। बम्बल बी अपने साथ परजीवी लेकर आती हैं, जो कई प्रकार की बीमारियाँ फैलाती हैं। इस वजह से बम्बल बी का आयात करना अब मुश्किल हो गया है। अंतर्राष्ट्रीय ख्याति प्राप्त वैज्ञानिक ने किया रेडी प्रदर्शनी का अवलोकन अंतर्राष्ट्रीय ख्याति प्राप्त वैज्ञानिक ने कहा इस प्रकार की रेडी प्रदर्शनी मैंने जीवन में पहली बार देखी, रेडी छात्रों ने अपनी कुशलता का शानदार प्रदर्शन किया है अन्य संस्थानों में भी यह कुशलता अपनाने की जरूरत है।इस दौरान डॉ. आई एम खान, डॉ. के सी शर्मा, डॉ. शैलेश गोदिका, डॉ. आर एन शर्मा, डॉ. बी एस बधाला, डॉ. राजेश सिंह, डॉ. संतोष देवी सामोता, डॉ. हीना सहीवाला सहित 122 छात्र-छात्राएं मौजूद रहे। मधुमक्खी पालन का महत्वमधुमक्खी पालन से शहद उत्पादन, मधुमक्खी मोम, रॉयल जेली, प्रोपोलिस आदि प्राप्त होते है और मधुमक्खी मधुमक्खी पालन का औषधीय और व्यवसायिक दृष्टिकोण से महत्वपूर्ण मूल्य है। मधुमक्खी पालन को एक लाभदायक उद्यम या उद्यमिता विकास के लिए एक माध्यम के रूप में माना जा सकता है। कार्बोहाइड्रेट्स, विटामिन, प्रोटीन, खनिजों का स्रोत और पर्याप्त औषधीय मूल्य होने के कारण, शहद की बढ़ती खपत ने किसानों के लिए मधुमक्खी पालक बनने का अवसर पैदा किया है।मधुमक्खी पालन से शहद व फसल उत्पादन में होती है बढ़ोतरीमधुमक्खी पालन सिर्फ शहद उत्पादन तक सीमित नहीं है, बल्कि यह कृषि उत्पादकता बढ़ाने, जैव विविधता संरक्षण और मानव स्वास्थ्य में भी महत्वपूर्ण योगदान देता है। उन्होंने कहा- मधुमक्खियां परागण की प्रक्रिया में अहम भूमिका निभाती हैं, जिससे फसलों का उत्पादन बढ़ता है। सरसों, राई और अन्य फूलदार फसलों के लिए मधुमक्खियां परागण में अत्यंत महत्वपूर्ण हैं। उन्होंने मधुमक्खी के डंक के औषधीय गुणों पर भी प्रकाश डाला। उन्होंने बताया कि एपीथेरेपी नामक एक पद्धति में मधुमक्खी के डंक का उपयोग दर्द, आर्थराइटिस, सूजन, और अन्य समस्याओं के इलाज में किया जाता है। \"यह एक प्राकृतिक और सुरक्षित उपचार का विकल्प हो सकता है,\" भारत में पाई जाने वाली प्रमुख मधुमक्खी की प्रजातियां भारत में प्रमुख प्रजातियां एपिस डोर्सटा, एपिस सेरेना इंडिका, एपिस फ्लोरिया और एपिस मेलिफेरा (यूरोपियन प्रजाति) जो आपको अतिरिक्त मात्रा में शहद प्रदान करती हैं। इनमें से एपिस सेरेना और एपिस मेलिफेरा प्रजातियाँ देश के उत्तरी राज्यों जैसे उत्तर प्रदेश, मध्य प्रदेश, राजस्थान, जम्मू और कश्मीर, हिमाचल प्रदेश, हरियाणा और दक्षिण भारत के राज्यों में केंद्रित हैं। मधुमक्खी पालन के लिए उपयुक्त जलवायुमधुमक्खियों की आजीविका तापमान से बहुत प्रभावित होती है। 13 डिग्री सेल्सियस से कम तापमान पर और 40 डिग्री सेल्सियस से ऊपर पहुंचने पर मधुमक्खियों की कार्यक्षमता कम हो जाती है और वे उड़ नहीं पाती हैं। राजस्थान का अर्ध-शुष्क क्षेत्र मधुमक्खी पालन के लिए काफी उपयुक्त है क्योंकि यहां सर्दियों और गर्मियों के मौसम के अधिकांश दिनों में तापमान अनुकूल रहता है जिसके कारण इसका पालन संभव है। शहद का उपयोगएक प्राकृतिक स्वीटनर होने और लगभग 80% कार्बोहाइड्रेट्स होने के कारण, शहद का उपयोग बेकरी, कंफेक्शनरी और पेय उद्योगों में किया जा सकता है। यह न केवल खाद्य पदार्थों में स्वाद जोड़ता है बल्कि यह उच्च ऊर्जा कार्बोहाइड्रेट्स का स्रोत है और आसानी से पचने योग्य है। इसे टेबल शहद के रूप में सेवन किया जा सकता है या कैंडी, केक, पके हुए खाद्य पदार्थों और जूस में एक घटक के रूप में इस्तेमाल किया जा सकता है। शहद में एंटीऑक्सीडेंट गुण होते हैं, जो कई बीमारियों के इलाज में मददगार साबित हो सकते हैं। शहद प्राकृतिक रूप से स्वास्थ्य के लिए फायदेमंद है और इसका नियमित सेवन शरीर की रोग प्रतिरोधक क्षमता को बढ़ाने में सहायक होता है।",

            "description": "People around the world suffered an average of 41 extra days of dangerous heat this year because of human-caused climate change, according to a group of scientists who also said that climate change worsened much of the world’s damaging weather throughout 2024.The analysis from World Weather Attribution and Climate Central researchers comes at the end of a year that shattered climate record after climate record as heat across the globe made 2024 likely to be its hottest ever measured and a slew of other fatal weather events spared few.“The finding is devastating but utterly unsurprising: Climate change did play a role, and often a major role in most of the events we studied, making heat, droughts, tropical cyclones and heavy rainfall more likely and more intense across the world, destroying lives and livelihoods of millions and often uncounted numbers of people,” Friederike Otto, the lead of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College climate scientist, said during a media briefing on the scientists’ findings. “As long as the world keeps burning fossil fuels, this will only get worse.”Millions of people endured stifling heat this year. Northern California and Death Valley baked. Sizzling daytime temperatures scorched Mexico and Central America. Heat endangered already vulnerable children in West Africa. Skyrocketing southern European temperatures forced Greece to close the Acropolis. In South and Southeast Asian countries, heat forced school closures. Earth experienced some of the hottest days ever measured and its hottest-yet summer, with a 13-month heat streak that just barely broke. Climate ChangeSep 18Studies reveal drastic increase in deaths related to extreme heatExtreme WeatherSep 3Extreme heat worsens chronic health conditions in millions of AmericansTo do its heat analysis, the team of volunteer international scientists compared daily temperatures around the globe in 2024 to the temperatures that would have been expected in a world without climate change. The results are not yet peer-reviewed, but researchers use peer-reviewed methods.Some areas saw 150 days or more of extreme heat due to climate change.“The poorest, least developed countries on the planet are the places that are experiencing even higher numbers,” said Kristina Dahl, vice president of climate science at Climate Central. What’s worse, heat-related deaths are often underreported. “People don’t have to die in heat waves. But if we can’t communicate convincingly, ‘but actually a lot of people are dying,’ it’s much harder to raise this awareness,” Otto said. “Heat waves are by far the deadliest extreme event, and they are the extreme events where climate change is a real game changer.”This year was a warning that the planet is getting dangerously close to the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warming limit compared to the pre-industrial average, according to the scientists. Earth is expected to soon edge past that threshold, although it’s not considered to have been breached until that warming is sustained over decades.The researchers closely examined 29 extreme weather events this year that killed at least 3,700 people and displaced millions, and found that 26 of them had clear links to climate change.The El Niño weather pattern, which naturally warms the Pacific Ocean and changes weather around the world, made some of this weather more likely earlier in the year. But the researchers said most of their studies found that climate change played a bigger role than that phenomenon in fueling 2024’s events. Warm ocean waters and warmer air fueled more destructive storms, according to the researchers, while temperatures led to many record-breaking downpours.Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod who wasn’t involved in the research, said the science and findings were sound.“Extreme weather will continue to become more frequent, intense, destructive, costly, and deadly, until we can lower the concentration of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere,” she said.Significantly more climate extremes could be expected without action, the United Nations Environment Programme said in the fall, as more planet-warming carbon dioxide has been sent into the air this year by burning fossil fuels than last year.But the deaths and damages from extreme weather events aren’t inevitable, said Julie Arrighi, director of programmes at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre and part of the research. “Countries can reduce those impacts by preparing for climate change and adapting for climate change, and while the challenges faced by individual countries or systems or places vary around the world, we do see that every country has a role to play,” she said.",

            "description": "Taylor Cagnacci moved from California to Tennessee with hopes of starting a new chapter in a state that touts a low cost of living and natural beauty. But she’s infuriated by Tennessee’s meager social services, which leave her and many other moms struggling in a state where abortion is banned with limited exceptions.“I was going to have my child no matter what, but for other women, that’s kind of a crappy situation that they put you in,” said Cagnacci, a 29-year-old Kingsport mom who relies on Medicaid and a federally funded nutrition program. “You have to have your child. But where’s the assistance afterward?”Tennessee has a porous safety net for mothers and young children, recent research and an analysis by The Associated Press found. It’s unknown how many women in the state have given birth because they didn’t have access to abortion, but it is clear that from the time a Tennessee woman gets pregnant, she faces greater obstacles to a healthy pregnancy, a healthy child and a financially stable family than the average American mom. abortionDec 23Abortion opponents shift focus to pills with lawsuits, proposed laws and possible federal actionabortionDec 13Texas' abortion pill lawsuit against New York doctor marks new challenge to interstate telemedicineabortionNov 26Why abortions rose after Roe was overturnedLike other states with strict abortion bans, Tennesseans of childbearing age are more likely to live in maternal care deserts and face overall doctor shortages. Women, infants and children are less likely to be enrolled in a government nutrition program known as WIC. And Tennessee is one of only 10 states that hasn’t expanded Medicaid to a greater share of low-income families.“It’s survival, every day,” said Janie Busbee, founder of Mother to Mother, a Nashville-based nonprofit providing baby supplies for low-income moms. “If we took some of that stress off of them, then maybe they’d have time to dream.”GOP state leaders in Tennessee and other states that banned abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 argue that they are bolstering services for families. Tennessee boosted its Medicaid coverage for mothers in 2022 from 60 days postpartum to a year, which allowed an additional 3,000 moms to use the program each year.The state also raised the Medicaid income limit for parents to the poverty level — nearly $26,000 for a family of three — and offers recipients 100 free diapers a month for babies under 2. According to the governor’s office, these changes have resulted in thousands of new parents accessing government services.“Pro-life is much more than defending the lives of the unborn,” Republican Gov. Bill Lee said in his 2023 annual address to lawmakers and echoed more recently on social media. “This is not a matter of politics. This is about human dignity.”Yet, nonprofit leaders and mothers told the AP there are still significant gaps in the safety net. Anika Chillis, a 39-year-old single mom in Memphis, has Medicaid, WIC and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as food stamps). While she’s deeply grateful for the help, she said it also can disappear — like when she temporarily lost WIC.“It’s hard,” she said, sitting on a park bench as her 2-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter played nearby. “Groceries are constantly going up.” And being a single mom “makes it doubly hard on you.”Medicaid and health care challengesTennessee fared poorly at WIC enrollment, Medicaid, having enough maternal care and requirements for paid family and medical leave, an October study found. Other states with similarly restrictive abortion laws — such as Idaho, Alabama, Missouri, Georgia and Mississippi — ranked poorly on numerous measures, too. Researchers said restrictive states had a slightly higher average birth rate and a much lower average abortion rate than the least restrictive states.“In general, these states that restrict abortion are the more fiscally conservative, the more socially conservative states,” said Dr. Nigel Madden, lead author of the study published in the American Journal of Public Health. The Republican supermajority in the Tennessee legislature has long rebuffed efforts to expand Medicaid to people earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $35,600 for a family of three. And TennCare faces criticism already, with a federal judge ruling earlier this year that the state unlawfully terminated coverage for thousands of families and had a “lethargic” response to nearly 250,000 children losing coverage because of paperwork problems caused by the state.DiJuana Davis, 44, was among the plaintiffs. In 2019, the Nashville resident was supposed to have surgery to prevent pregnancy and ease her chronic anemia. Days before the procedure, she was informed her Medicaid coverage had been cut off and the hospital was canceling. She later found out her renewal paperwork went to the wrong address, an error that left her uninsured for two months — during which she became pregnant and developed preeclampsia. Doctors induced labor to save her life, and her son was born prematurely.“The system is broken,” she said, “and it needs to be fixed.”More than 3% of the 83,000 babies born in Tennessee in 2023 had mothers who didn’t receive prenatal care. Only seven states had a higher share, according to an AP analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.After birth, doctor shortages impede ongoing care. Around a third of Tennesseans live in a primary care shortage area — a greater share than in all but 10 other states — according to an AP analysis of data from the Census Bureau and the Health Resources and Services Administration. Food and diaper programsMoms described several aid programs as frustrating to navigate. Chillis was on WIC for several months after her son was born, but then went without because of a mistake during the renewal process — eventually getting it restored with help from the nonprofit Tennessee Justice Center.Chillis credits a nonprofit preschool provider with linking her to aid programs in the first place: “I don’t see a lot of advertisements about, you know, how you can join this program or go get this” service, she said. “People just don’t have the knowledge.”Cagnacci, who is pregnant and has a 1-year-old, said she was on SNAP for a while but missed an appointment and was unclear about the steps after that. The process to get recertified was “such a headache” that she’s going without it.“I just felt like it was purposely being made difficult so that I would just give up,” she said.Women with young children in states where abortion is banned or limited to early weeks of pregnancy said it can be tough to get social services there, according to a survey by the health policy research organization KFF. Nearly half said it’s difficult for women in their state to get food stamps, for example, compared with 3 in 10 in states where abortion is generally available.“People who claim to be pro-life, who advocated for these abortion bans, often suggest that these policies are designed to protect children, women and families,” said Madden, the researcher. But the weakness of the safety net shows “the hypocrisy of that argument.”Tennessee’s new diaper program shows the deep political divisions surrounding aid programs. The Republican governor described it as an effort to strengthen families while Democratic state Sen. London Lamar said GOP leaders are “trying to put a little bow on an abortion ban.” And GOP state Sen. Mark Pody recently told the right-leaning news website Tennessee Conservative that “it is not the state’s responsibility to have a diaper for every single baby” and floated the possibility of cutting the program. Charities struggle to fill gapsOf Tennessee’s 2.8 million households, 30% earn above the poverty level but not enough to afford the basic cost of living in their counties, according to a recent report. Often, they don’t qualify for government help.“Some are working three jobs and still can’t survive,” said Busbee, of Mother to Mother.A fragmented patchwork of charities can help, but they don’t cover the entire state. The Nashville Diaper Connection, for example, serves 30 counties, working with partners to provide 50 diapers a month, mostly to working families who make a bit too much for Medicaid. Other nonprofits are hindered in helping by government agencies’ income rules. And most charities are constrained by the ebb and flow of donations.Nonprofit leaders fear their job may get harder with a new administration in Washington and a GOP-controlled Congress. Republicans could seek significant changes to federal assistance programs they’ve long criticized, like Medicaid and food stamps.“We’ve been through four years of a Trump administration, and the goal under the Trump administration was to cut social services,” said Signe Anderson, the justice center’s senior director of nutrition advocacy. “I’m concerned ... for families in Tennessee and across the country.”___Kruesi reported from Nashville, Tennessee.

            "description": "Taylor Cagnacci moved from California to Tennessee with hopes of starting a new chapter in a state that touts a low cost of living and natural beauty. But she’s infuriated by Tennessee’s meager social services, which leave her and many other moms struggling in a state where abortion is banned with limited exceptions.“I was going to have my child no matter what, but for other women, that’s kind of a crappy situation that they put you in,” said Cagnacci, a 29-year-old Kingsport mom who relies on Medicaid and a federally funded nutrition program. “You have to have your child. But where’s the assistance afterward?”Tennessee has a porous safety net for mothers and young children, recent research and an analysis by The Associated Press found. It’s unknown how many women in the state have given birth because they didn’t have access to abortion, but it is clear that from the time a Tennessee woman gets pregnant, she faces greater obstacles to a healthy pregnancy, a healthy child and a financially stable family than the average American mom. abortionDec 23Abortion opponents shift focus to pills with lawsuits, proposed laws and possible federal actionabortionDec 13Texas' abortion pill lawsuit against New York doctor marks new challenge to interstate telemedicineabortionNov 26Why abortions rose after Roe was overturnedLike other states with strict abortion bans, Tennesseans of childbearing age are more likely to live in maternal care deserts and face overall doctor shortages. Women, infants and children are less likely to be enrolled in a government nutrition program known as WIC. And Tennessee is one of only 10 states that hasn’t expanded Medicaid to a greater share of low-income families.“It’s survival, every day,” said Janie Busbee, founder of Mother to Mother, a Nashville-based nonprofit providing baby supplies for low-income moms. “If we took some of that stress off of them, then maybe they’d have time to dream.”GOP state leaders in Tennessee and other states that banned abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 argue that they are bolstering services for families. Tennessee boosted its Medicaid coverage for mothers in 2022 from 60 days postpartum to a year, which allowed an additional 3,000 moms to use the program each year.The state also raised the Medicaid income limit for parents to the poverty level — nearly $26,000 for a family of three — and offers recipients 100 free diapers a month for babies under 2. According to the governor’s office, these changes have resulted in thousands of new parents accessing government services.“Pro-life is much more than defending the lives of the unborn,” Republican Gov. Bill Lee said in his 2023 annual address to lawmakers and echoed more recently on social media. “This is not a matter of politics. This is about human dignity.”Yet, nonprofit leaders and mothers told the AP there are still significant gaps in the safety net. Anika Chillis, a 39-year-old single mom in Memphis, has Medicaid, WIC and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as food stamps). While she’s deeply grateful for the help, she said it also can disappear — like when she temporarily lost WIC.“It’s hard,” she said, sitting on a park bench as her 2-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter played nearby. “Groceries are constantly going up.” And being a single mom “makes it doubly hard on you.”Medicaid and health care challengesTennessee fared poorly at WIC enrollment, Medicaid, having enough maternal care and requirements for paid family and medical leave, an October study found. Other states with similarly restrictive abortion laws — such as Idaho, Alabama, Missouri, Georgia and Mississippi — ranked poorly on numerous measures, too. Researchers said restrictive states had a slightly higher average birth rate and a much lower average abortion rate than the least restrictive states.“In general, these states that restrict abortion are the more fiscally conservative, the more socially conservative states,” said Dr. Nigel Madden, lead author of the study published in the American Journal of Public Health. The Republican supermajority in the Tennessee legislature has long rebuffed efforts to expand Medicaid to people earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $35,600 for a family of three. And TennCare faces criticism already, with a federal judge ruling earlier this year that the state unlawfully terminated coverage for thousands of families and had a “lethargic” response to nearly 250,000 children losing coverage because of paperwork problems caused by the state.DiJuana Davis, 44, was among the plaintiffs. In 2019, the Nashville resident was supposed to have surgery to prevent pregnancy and ease her chronic anemia. Days before the procedure, she was informed her Medicaid coverage had been cut off and the hospital was canceling. She later found out her renewal paperwork went to the wrong address, an error that left her uninsured for two months — during which she became pregnant and developed preeclampsia. Doctors induced labor to save her life, and her son was born prematurely.“The system is broken,” she said, “and it needs to be fixed.”More than 3% of the 83,000 babies born in Tennessee in 2023 had mothers who didn’t receive prenatal care. Only seven states had a higher share, according to an AP analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.After birth, doctor shortages impede ongoing care. Around a third of Tennesseans live in a primary care shortage area — a greater share than in all but 10 other states — according to an AP analysis of data from the Census Bureau and the Health Resources and Services Administration. Food and diaper programsMoms described several aid programs as frustrating to navigate. Chillis was on WIC for several months after her son was born, but then went without because of a mistake during the renewal process — eventually getting it restored with help from the nonprofit Tennessee Justice Center.Chillis credits a nonprofit preschool provider with linking her to aid programs in the first place: “I don’t see a lot of advertisements about, you know, how you can join this program or go get this” service, she said. “People just don’t have the knowledge.”Cagnacci, who is pregnant and has a 1-year-old, said she was on SNAP for a while but missed an appointment and was unclear about the steps after that. The process to get recertified was “such a headache” that she’s going without it.“I just felt like it was purposely being made difficult so that I would just give up,” she said.Women with young children in states where abortion is banned or limited to early weeks of pregnancy said it can be tough to get social services there, according to a survey by the health policy research organization KFF. Nearly half said it’s difficult for women in their state to get food stamps, for example, compared with 3 in 10 in states where abortion is generally available.“People who claim to be pro-life, who advocated for these abortion bans, often suggest that these policies are designed to protect children, women and families,” said Madden, the researcher. But the weakness of the safety net shows “the hypocrisy of that argument.”Tennessee’s new diaper program shows the deep political divisions surrounding aid programs. The Republican governor described it as an effort to strengthen families while Democratic state Sen. London Lamar said GOP leaders are “trying to put a little bow on an abortion ban.” And GOP state Sen. Mark Pody recently told the right-leaning news website Tennessee Conservative that “it is not the state’s responsibility to have a diaper for every single baby” and floated the possibility of cutting the program.

            "description": "U.S. Dollar Surges Amid Global Economic Shifts The U.S. dollar is poised for an impressive 7% annual increase, with Japan's yen enduring yet another year of losses. Traders attribute the dollar's strength to anticipated solid U.S. economic growth, prompting the Federal Reserve to proceed cautiously on rate cuts, potentially extending into 2025.The dollar index recorded a slight rise as the currency approached significant monthly and yearly gains, while the yen faced considerable declines. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the central bank's cautious stance on further rate cuts, fueling trade activity in major markets.Global economies brace for the impact of President-elect Donald Trump's proposed policies, perceived to be both growth-stimulating and inflationary. Market watchers expect the Bank of Japan to maintain its monetary stance and predict further easing by the European Central Bank as the eurozone experiences economic slowdown.",

            "description": "Tragedy struck off the coast of Morocco when a makeshift boat carrying around 80 people, mostly from West Africa, capsized while en route to Spain. The mishap has claimed the lives of at least 69 people, including 25 Malians, according to Mali's authorities. Only 11 people survived the ordeal, with at least nine of them being from Mali. Also Read: South Korean opposition votes for impeachment of current president Han Duck-Soo; Here's what happens next The boat capsized last week (Dec 19), but the Ministry of Malians Abroad confirmed the incident on Thursday. A crisis unit has been dispatched to monitor the situation. This tragic event highlights the dangers of migrant crossings from Africa to Europe. Mali has been plagued by years of jihadist and separatist violence, and there were military coups in 2020 and 2021. The country's instability, coupled with unemployment and the effects of climate change on farming, has driven many to seek better opportunities in Europe. However, the journey is perilous, with over 10,000 people having lost their lives attempting to reach Spain by boat from Africa this year, according to Spanish rights charity Caminando Fronteras. This averages out to around 30 deaths per day, making this migration route one of the most treacherous in the world. The route spans from the Atlantic coasts of Mauritania and Morocco to Spain, with many migrants hailing from sub-Saharan Africa, fleeing poverty and conflict in their home countries. Morocco's proximity to Spain, just eight nautical miles apart at their closest point, makes it a popular departure point for migrants.

            "description": "Under the leadership of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the Mahakumbh 2025 will make history with the goal of setting several world records, including one for conducting eye tests and distributing glasses. The upcoming “Netra Kumbh” (Eye Kumbh) event, to be inaugurated on January 5, 2025, aims to provide eye tests for 500,000 individuals and distribute over 300,000 glasses, marking the largest eye care initiative of its kind. The Netra Kumbh, located on a sprawling 10-acre site near the Nagvasuki Temple, is set to become a landmark event in the field of public health. This initiative, a first in history, aims to provide free eye tests to half a million devotees and distribute 300,000 pairs of glasses during the event. Organisers have set a target of 10,000 eye tests per day to achieve the ambitious goal. The event will also offer free medicines alongside eye tests and glasses distribution. Dr. Ranjan Bajpai, a member of the organising committee, shared that the inaugural ceremony of the Netra Kumbh will be led by Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Avdheshanand Giri Maharaj of Juna Akhada, with Maharaj Gaurang Prabhu Ji and Dr. Krishna Gopal Ji, Sangh’s Saha Sarkaryavah, as special guests. Last time, the event was recognised by the Limca Book of World Records, and efforts are underway to secure a place in the Guinness World Records this time. The Netra Kumbh is set up with high-level infrastructure, including 11 hangars, a significant increase from the five hangars in the previous event. Each hangar will serve as a station for eye tests, with dedicated OPD chambers for registration and doctor consultations. The organisers have partnered with 240 hospitals across India, bringing doctors from various regions to provide specialised care. Rajesh Kumar Singh, in charge of crowd management, revealed that arrangements for the accommodation and food of the doctors have been made, with 40 dormitories for doctors, and separate facilities for female doctors and volunteers. Additionally, 16-bed dormitories for pilgrims and 8-bed dormitories for volunteers are also available. A key feature of the Netra Kumbh will be the establishment of a special eye donation camp, inspired by Emperor Harshvardhan of Prayagraj’s charitable legacy. As a part of the initiative, people across India and even from abroad are encouraged to pledge eye donations. The importance of eye donation is underscored by the fact that over 1.5 crore people in India suffer from blindness, many of whom are in need of corneal transplants. Sunil Kumar Singh, a member of the organising committee, emphasised that previous Netra Kumbh events saw over 11,000 people pledge their eyes for donation. The organisers hope to continue this tradition and make a significant impact in the fight against blindness.",

            "description": "This article is part of “Dealing the Dead,” an NBC News series investigating the use of unclaimed bodies for medical research.The revelation that a Texas medical school was routinely dissecting the bodies of unclaimed people and leasing them out to for-profit medical device companies for training and research drew a rapid and far-reaching response. NBC News’ investigation into the University of North Texas Health Science Center led to changes even before the first article ran, with the center announcing in response to the reporters’ findings that it was suspending its body donation program and firing the officials who led it. Medical technology companies that had received unclaimed bodies from the center also pre-emptively said they were changing policies or re-evaluating their work with the program. When the first part of the investigation was published online and aired on NBC’s “Nightly News with Lester Holt,” elected officials at the local, state and federal level expressed alarm at what had occurred and said they would push for policy changes to prevent it from ever happening again. After obtaining the names of hundreds of people whose unclaimed bodies were sent to the Health Science Center, reporters discovered that some families had been unaware their relatives’ bodies had been donated. To help survivors find answers, NBC News later published the names of the unclaimed dead, leading several more families to come forward, aghast at what they learned but grateful to finally know the truth. “How does something like that happen?” Tim Leggett said after spotting the name of his brother, Denzil “Dale” Leggett, on the list. “How could somebody not realize, ‘Hey, this person’s probably got family here?’” Tim Leggett learned of his brother’s death and donation to the Health Science Center from an article published by NBC News. (Zerb Mellish for NBC News)Here is more detail on the impact of NBC News’ “Dealing the Dead” series, which includes changes meant to ensure the bodies of the unclaimed dead are treated with respect and dignity in North Texas and beyond. 1. UNT’s Health Science Center fired officials and stopped accepting unclaimed bodiesThe University of North Texas Health Science Center initially defended its use of unclaimed bodies, but after NBC News presented its detailed findings, the center announced that it was suspending its body donation program, firing the officials who led it and hiring a consulting firm to investigate. “As a result of the information brought to light through your inquiries, it has become clear that failures existed in the management and oversight of The University of North Texas Health Science Center’s Willed Body Program,” the center said in a statement. For years, the Health and Science Center acquired, studied and leased out the bodies of the unclaimed dead but abruptly halted the practice in September in response to an NBC News investigation. (Shelby Tauber for NBC News)Days later, the Health Science Center said it would stop accepting unclaimed bodies, explaining that its decision was based on information uncovered through reporters’ requests. These documents detailed “deficiencies in leadership, standards of respect and care, and professionalism exhibited,” the center’s president, Sylvia Trent-Adams, wrote in an email to students, faculty and staff. University of North Texas spokesperson Andy North also apologized to families in a statement to NBC News: “The Willed Body and BioSkills programs fell short of the standards of respect, care and professionalism that we demand. We are working to connect with families to extend our deepest apologies.” 2. Medical technology companies changed policies and cut ties with the Health Science CenterCompanies, teaching hospitals and medical schools that relied on the Health Science Center also took action. DePuy Synthes, a Johnson & Johnson company, said it had paused its relationship with the center. Boston Scientific said that it was no longer working with the center and that it had updated its global policy “to require consent by the individual or next-of-kin.” Dr. Douglas Hampers, National Bioskills Laboratories’ CEO, said his company would ensure that it no longer accepted unclaimed bodies. “I don’t think you have to violate a family’s rights in order to train physicians,” he said.In all, 10 organizations and companies said they did not know the center had provided them with unclaimed bodies.3. The Army said it would clarify its policies on unclaimed bodiesThe Army, which had received dozens of bodies and body parts from the Health Science Center, said it, too, was examining its reliance on the center’s Willed Body Program. The Army also said it planned to review and clarify internal policies on the use of unclaimed bodies.Separately, Terrence Hayes, spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, offered condolences to the family of Victor Honey, a homeless veteran whose body was cut up and leased out to medical device companies and the Army without his consent or his relatives’ knowledge.“We were extremely saddened to hear of his and his family’s story,” Hayes said in a statement. “Mr. Honey, like all Veterans who have served our nation with courage and honor, deserved a dignified burial at the time of his passing.”Victor Honey’s ex-wife, Kimberly Patman, and his son who shares his first and last name weren’t notified when Honey died. (Zerb Mellish for NBC News)4. Tarrant County made changes to treat the unclaimed dead with dignity Hundreds of unclaimed bodies flowed to the University of North Texas from Tarrant and Dallas counties, which saw the arrangement as a cost savings. The contracts the counties signed to turn over their unclaimed dead to the Health Science Center drew little scrutiny prior to NBC News’ reporting. When reporters shared their findings — including the stories of heartbroken family members — with the top elected official in Tarrant County, Judge Tim O’Hare, he responded by saying that he planned to explore legal options “to end any and all immoral, unethical, and irresponsible practices stemming from this program.” He called NBC News’ reporting “disturbing, to say the least.” O’Hare followed up by leading the Tarrant County Commissioners Court in unanimously voting to adopt a new policy requiring officials to make more strenuous efforts to contact the deceased’s next of kin and to take their religious beliefs into account when deciding whether to bury or cremate them. Tarrant County commissioners adopted a policy meant to ensure unclaimed bodies are treated with dignity. (Shelby Tauber for NBC News)In addition, Tarrant County began publishing the names of unclaimed people on the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, a free public database meant to connect reports of missing people to unclaimed bodies. Dallas County leaders said they also planned to review policies for handling unclaimed bodies.5. A Texas lawmaker announced a bill to ban medical research on unclaimed bodiesState Sen. Tan Parker, a Republican, announced plans to introduce a bill in the next legislative session in January to prohibit the use of people’s bodies for research unless they or their survivors give full consent. He said he had no idea before seeing NBC News’ investigation that the Health Science Center had made money off of unclaimed bodies by dissecting them and leasing out the body parts. “I was outraged and completely just disgusted to see what had been occurring,” Parker said. “Human life is sacred and needs to always be protected, and that is a core principle to me.”Texas State Sen. Tan Parker pledged to outlaw the use of unclaimed bodies in Texas. (Texas Senate Media Services)6. Texas authorities ordered the Health Science Center to stop liquefying bodiesThe Texas Funeral Service Commission, which regulates body donation programs in the state, said it was conducting a review as well. The commission inspected the Health Science Center in October, after NBC News began publishing its investigation, and sent a cease-and-desist letter ordering the center to stop its practice of liquefying bodies after using them for training and research. The center had turned to alkaline hydrolysis, also known as water cremation, to save money, which the Funeral Commission said was illegal. “This practice is not authorized under Texas state law and constitutes a serious violation of the standards governing the lawful disposition of human remains,” the commission said in the letter to Trent-Adams, the Health Science Center’s president.The center defended the legality of the practice in a statement to NBC News but said it had halted water cremations in September — on the same day NBC News’ investigation was published. 7. Members of Congress pressed local officials for informationU.S. Reps. Jasmine Crockett and Marc Veasey requested answers from officials in Dallas and Tarrant counties, saying they were “shocked” by NBC News’ investigation, including reporters’ finding that the unclaimed bodies included veterans who are entitled to federal benefits that cover military funerals. In a letter to Dallas and Tarrant counties, they expressed particular concern that Victor Honey’s body had been used without anyone notifying his family that he was dead. “By failing to contact Mr. Honey’s family, he was deprived of the rights he earned by bravely serving our country,” Crockett and Veasey wrote. “This case alone raises serious concerns regarding how Dallas and Tarrant County investigators attempt to satisfy the ‘diligent inquiry’ requirement set forth by state law.”Rep. Jasmine Crockett said she was “shocked” by NBC News’ investigation. (Al Drago / Bloomberg via Getty Images file)8. Families found long-sought answers about their relativesNBC News’ reporting had a significant impact on families who hadn’t known what happened to their loved ones. As of December, reporters have identified at least 25 people whose bodies were sent to the Health Science Center without their relatives’ knowledge; 11 of those people’s families learned details of what happened from NBC News.As a public service, NBC News published a list of more than 1,800 people whose bodies were sent to the Health Science Center, to help readers who are searching for answers about their loved ones. Noticias Telemundo, which is part of NBCUniversal, published a Spanish-language version of the list. Reporters heard from six readers who learned of their family members’ death or donation when they discovered their names on the list.Nika Hodges’ family had spent years searching for her before finding her name on the list of unclaimed bodies published by NBC News. (Courtesy Abigail Willson)“We didn’t know she was dead or what happened to her,” said Abigail Willson, whose mother, Nika Michelle Hodges, died at a Fort Worth hospice last year and whose body was then donated without her consent to the Health Science Center. “We have searched everywhere, all over Texas. If you wouldn’t have put out that list of names, we never would have known.”This story originally appeared on NBCNews.com.
