The visa was issued on Friday after an interview at Mumbai's US Consulate office.Informing about the development, the student's father Tanhaji Shinde said that they had received a call from the embassy and were granted visa within half an hour. He also mentioned that the family received help from both the central and the Maharashtra government.\"I received a phone call from her roommate on February 16. However, she didn't tell me about the accident. Later, she informed Neelam's uncle about it. She is still in coma, however, her condition has improved slightly. We came here (to the embassy). They took our interview and granted Visa in half an hour. We will leave (for the US) tomorrow. Both the Cental and Maharashtra government helped us a lot. The media also helped us. My daughter is in coma, we can't do much. I just wish she gets well soon,\" he said.Nilam Shinde was taking a walk at Sacramento when a speeding vehicle hit her. She sufferedsevere fractures to her legs, skull, left arm, and a brain injury which left her in coma.Meanwhile, Shinde's uncle Sanjay Kadam praised the Centre and state government for their help and requested that the process of getting an emergency visa be eased.\"Neelam sustained major injuries, and she is in coma. The central govt and state govt did a good job, and we have now got the Visa. Earlier, we were trying to book a slot (at the US Consulate) via agents, but then this news reached the govt through the media, and the govt helped us... We request the Indian govt that the process of Emergency Visa should be eased,\" he said.The Indian consulate in San Francisco had expressed solidarity with Shinde's family and assured all support to them.

During the interactive chat, she also addressed questions about artificial intelligence and social media. Preity Zinta Responds to Question on Defamation Case Against Rahul Gandhi At the start of the session, Preity tweeted, \"Suddenly, today seems like the perfect day for #Pzchat! Any advice for the chat, or should we keep it simple? Let me know, guys, because I have an hour to chat.\" During the AMA, a fan asked, \"Are you planning to file a defamation case against Rahul Gandhi?\" Preity responded, \"I don't think it's okay to insult someone like that because he is not responsible for someone else's actions. I believe in addressing issues directly, not fighting someone else’s battle. Also, I have no problem with Rahul Gandhi, so let him live in peace, and I will do the same (smiling face emoji).\" I don’t think it’s fair to vilify anyone like that, as he is not responsible for someone else’s actions. I believe in handling problems or issues directly & not through proxy battles. I also have no problem with Rahul Gandhi, so let him live in peace & I will live in peace too 😀 https://t.co/LAAGOdOJri — Preity G Zinta (@realpreityzinta) February 27, 2025 Preity Zinta on Entering Politics Another fan asked, \"You are truly a soldier, Preity! Salute to you! Are you planning to join politics?\" She replied, \"No! No politics for me. Over the years, many parties have offered me tickets and Rajya Sabha seats, but I have politely declined because it's not what I want. Calling me a soldier isn’t entirely wrong, though, as I am a soldier's daughter and an army officer's sister (smiling face emoji).\" Preity Zinta on National Identity Emphasizing her patriotism, Preity said, \"We children of soldiers are not North Indian or South Indian or Himachali or Bengali. We are simply Indian. Patriotism and national pride are in our blood.

            "description": "Bhopal: A session court in Bhopal on Thursday sentenced a woman to life imprisonment for killing her one-month-old daughter and also imposed a fine of Rs 1,000. The court of Additional Sessions Judge Atul Saxena found Sarita Mewada guilty under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 302. Judge Saxena awarded life imprisonment to the convict and imposed the fine under the said Section. The incident occurred in September 2020. The convict, Sarita, wished for a boy but she gave birth to a girl. Whenever she saw her daughter, she used to curse herself. Following which, one day taking advantage of a situation of being alone in the home, she killed her daughter by putting her into a water tank. Public Prosecutor Sudhavijay Singh Bhadoria said, \"The case is related to the incident that took place on September 16, 2020. Sarita said that she laid her daughter on a cot but she was not on the cot and there was none other than her in the house. Later, when searched, the little one was found dead in a water tank kept inside the house.\" \"Sarita's husband, Sachin Mewada said in his statement that when he questioned his wife Sarita, she started crying and said that she had put her one-month-old daughter in the water tank and closed the lid. Sarita had thought that she would have a boy, but when she gave birth to a girl, she did not love the girl. Whenever she saw her, she started cursing herself. Therefore, taking the opportunity that there was no one in the house, she put the daughter in the water tank and closed the lid and did not tell this to anyone due to fear,\" Bhadoria said. Following the incident, an FIR was registered under IPC Section 302 at Khajuri Sadak police station in the state capital and began the investigation. Based on the evidence collected from the incident site and after complete investigation, a charge sheet was presented before the Court, she said. During the trial of the case, the court agreed with the evidence, arguments and precedents presented by the prosecution. The court convicted the accused and sentenced her to life imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1,000 under Section 302 of the IPC, the Public Prosecutor said. Additionally, while passing judgment on the case, the court made a special comment that daughters are a powerful signature of civilisation, culture, and nation-building in the present era.",

            "description": "रीवा के शिल्पी प्लाजा स्थित लोकायुक्त कार्यालय में गुरुवार देर रात भीषण आग लग गई। बताया जा रहा है कि आग शॉर्ट सर्किट के कारण लगी। सूचना मिलते ही फायर ब्रिगेड की दो गाड़ियां मौके पर पहुंचीं और करीब 4 घंटे की मशक्कत के बाद आग पर काबू पाया गया। लोकायुक्त कार्यालय के गार्ड शिवलाल साकेत ने बताया कि सबसे पहले उन्हें कांच टूटने की आवाज सुनाई दी, जिससे उन्हें लगा कि कोई चोर घुस आया है। जब उन्होंने मौके पर जाकर देखा तो आग लग चुकी थी, जो धीरे-धीरे भयानक रूप धारण कर गई। आग की लपटों के कारण कार्यालय में रखा पुराना रिकॉर्ड जलकर खाक हो गया। सूत्र- 50 से अधिक पुराने दस्तावेज जलेघटना रात करीब 10:30 बजे हुई। आग लगने के बाद धुएं का गुबार पूरे भवन में फैल गया। घटना की जानकारी मिलते ही लोकायुक्त कार्यालय के वरिष्ठ अधिकारी और सिविल लाइन थाने की पुलिस मौके पर पहुंच गई। लोकायुक्त कार्यालय के अधिकारियों ने आग में जले दस्तावेजों को अनुपयोगी बताया है, लेकिन सूत्रों के मुताबिक 50 से अधिक पुराने कागजात जलकर नष्ट हो गए हैं। सिविल लाइन थाना प्रभारी कमलेश साहू के मुताबिक आग लगने की सही वजह का अब तक खुलासा नहीं हो सका है, लेकिन प्राथमिक जांच में शॉर्ट सर्किट को कारण बताया जा रहा है। हालांकि, इस मामले में लोकायुक्त के अधिकारी फिलहाल कोई आधिकारिक बयान देने से बच रहे हैं। अगर समय पर आग पर काबू नहीं पाया जाता तो आसपास के शासकीय कार्यालयों की महत्वपूर्ण फाइलें भी इसकी चपेट में आ सकती थीं। मामले की जांच जारी है। सिविल लाइन थाना प्रभारी कमलेश साहू के मुताबिक आग लगने की वजह का खुलासा नहीं हो पाया है। लेकिन प्रथम दृष्टया शार्ट शर्किट की वजह से आग लगना बताया जा रहा है। बाकी सब कुछ जांच के बाद ही स्पष्ट हो पाएगा।",

            "description": "मध्यप्रदेश में मार्च के पहले सप्ताह में बादल छाने और हल्की बारिश होने के आसार हैं। 2 मार्च से पश्चिम-उत्तर भारत में वेस्टर्न डिस्टरबेंस (पश्चिमी विक्षोभ) एक्टिव हो रहा है। जिसका असर प्रदेश में भी देखने को मिल सकता है। खासकर 4 मार्च से इंदौर, ग्वालियर, चंबल हिस्से में कहीं-कहीं मौसम बदला हुआ रह सकता है। इससे पहले दिन-रात के तापमान में 2 से 4 डिग्री तक की बढ़ोतरी देखने को मिलेगी। फरवरी में मौसम का मिला-जुला असर रहा। शुरुआती दिनों में ही तेज ठंड पड़ी, लेकिन दूसरे सप्ताह से ठंड जैसी गायब सी हो गई। भोपाल, इंदौर, ग्वालियर, उज्जैन, जबलपुर समेत कई शहरों में रात का पारा 10 डिग्री से अधिक ही रहा। वहीं, दिन में 34 डिग्री तक पहुंच चुका है। फरवरी के आखिरी दिन शुक्रवार को भी मौसम का मिजाज ऐसा ही बना रहेगा, लेकिन मार्च के पहले सप्ताह में मौसम में फिर से बदलाव देखने को मिल सकता है। दो दिन बाद असरउत्तर-पश्चिमी भारत में सक्रिय होने वाले वेस्टर्न डिस्टरबेंस का असर प्रदेश में 2 दिन बाद यानी, 4 मार्च से देखने को मिल सकता है। इसके अलावा एक साइक्लोनिक सकुर्लेशन सिस्टम भी एक्टिव है। इस कारण भोपाल समेत कई शहरों में बादल छाए रहे। रात के पारे में बढ़ोतरी, 10 डिग्री के पार पहुंचाप्रदेश में पांच दिन तक तेज ठंड पड़ी। इस वजह से पचमढ़ी समेत कई शहरों में पारा 10 डिग्री से नीचे ही रहा, लेकिन बुधवार-गुरुवार की रात में पारे में फिर से बढ़ोतरी होने लगी। कई शहरों में पारा 2 से 4 डिग्री तक बढ़ गया। पचमढ़ी में 10.2 डिग्री, कल्याणपुर में 10.3 डिग्री, शाजापुर के गिरवर में 11.2 डिग्री, उमरिया में 11.3 डिग्री, अशोकनगर के आंवरी में 11.6 डिग्री और मंडला में पारा 12 डिग्री तक दर्ज किया गया। इधर, गुरुवार को दिन के तापमान में भी बढ़ोतरी देखने को मिली है। अगले 2 दिन ऐसा मौसम28 फरवरी: तापमान में बढ़ोतरी देखने को मिलेगी। कहीं-कहीं बादल भी छा सकते हैं।1 मार्च: भोपाल, इंदौर समेत कई शहर में दिन का पारा 2 से 3 डिग्री तक बढ़ सकता है। फरवरी में 10 साल का ट्रेंड... तीनों मौसम का असरप्रदेश में पिछले 10 साल के आंकड़ों पर नजर डालें, तो फरवरी महीने में रातें ठंडी और दिन गर्म रहते हैं। बारिश का ट्रेंड भी है। इस बार भी ऐसा ही मौसम रहा है। भोपाल, इंदौर और उज्जैन में दिन का अधिकतम तापमान 30 डिग्री के पार पहुंच गया, जबकि रात में 10 से 17 डिग्री के बीच रहा। मौसम विभाग के अनुसार, फरवरी में सबसे ज्यादा ग्वालियर ठिठुरता है। पिछले साल यहां न्यूनतम तापमान 6.1 डिग्री तक पहुंचा था, लेकिन इससे पहले 5 डिग्री के नीचे ही रहा है। जबलपुर में दिन में गर्मी और रात में ठंड रहती है। फरवरी के 27 दिनों में मौसम में उतार-चढ़ाव की स्थिति देखने को मिली। इस बार 2 महीने कड़ाके की ठंडअब बात ठंड की ओवरऑल स्थिति की। इस बार शुरुआती दो महीने यानी, नवंबर और दिसंबर में कड़ाके की ठंड पड़ी। ठंड ने कई रिकॉर्ड तोड़ दिए। नवंबर की बात करें तो भोपाल में 36 साल का रिकॉर्ड टूटा। इंदौर, उज्जैन, जबलपुर और ग्वालियर में भी पारा सामान्य से 7 डिग्री तक नीचे रहा। वहीं, दिसंबर में भी ठंड ने रिकॉर्ड तोड़ा। स्थिति यह रही कि पूरे प्रदेश में जनवरी से भी ठंडा दिसंबर रहा। भोपाल समेत कई शहरों में ठंड ने रिकॉर्ड तोड़ दिए। 9 दिन शीतलहर चली। भोपाल में दिसंबर की सर्दी ने 58 साल का रिकॉर्ड तोड़ दिया। भोपाल, इंदौर, ग्वालियर समेत कई जिलों में स्कूलों की टाइमिंग बदल दी गई है, जबकि भोपाल के वन विहार नेशनल पार्क में जानवरों को सर्दी से बचाने के लिए हीटर लगाए गए। भगवान को भी ठंड से बचाने के लिए जतन किए गए। अब बात जनवरी की। शुरुआत 10 से 15 दिन तक कड़ाके की ठंड का दौर रहा, लेकिन फिर तेवर ठंडे हो गए। ठंड के दो दौर आए, जबकि तीन बार मावठा गिरा। मौसम वैज्ञानिक डॉ. सिंह ने बताया, जनवरी में ठंड का असर जरूर रहा, लेकिन पिछले 10 साल के ट्रेंड के अनुसार तेज सर्दी नहीं पड़ी। पश्चिमी विक्षोभ की स्ट्रॉन्ग एक्टिविटी नहीं होने से तेज बारिश का दौर नहीं रहा। न ही ओले गिरे, जबकि जनवरी में ओला-बारिश का दौर भी रहता है। फरवरी में ओले नहीं गिरे। कुछ ही जिलों में हल्की बारिश दर्ज की गई। MP के 5 बड़े शहरों में फरवरी में ऐसा रहा है सर्दी का ट्रेंड... भोपाल में रातें ठंडी रहती है, दिन गर्मराजधानी भोपाल में रातें ठंडी रहती हैं, जबकि दिन गर्म। वर्ष 2015 से 2024 के बीच 4 साल दिन का अधिकतम तापमान 35 डिग्री के पार पहुंच गया। रात में 7 साल पारा 10 डिग्री से कम दर्ज किया गया। इस महीने बारिश होने का भी ट्रेंड है। हालांकि, 10 साल में सिर्फ 3 बार ही पानी गिरा है। रिकॉर्ड की बात करें तो 11 फरवरी 1950 को रात का पारा 1.7 डिग्री रहा था, जो ओवरऑल रिकॉर्ड है। 22 फरवरी 2006 को अधिकतम तापमान 37.6 डिग्री रहा था। साल 1986 को एक महीने में 2 इंच से ज्यादा पानी गिरा था। इस बार बारिश नहीं हुई। इंदौर में गर्मी का असर रहाफरवरी के महीने में

किया गया था। यहां रात में पारा 10 डिग्री के नीचे रहता है। हालांकि, पिछले साल यह 12 डिग्री रहा था। यहां 1 फरवरी 1929 को रात का पारा रिकॉर्ड 2.8 डिग्री पहुंच चुका है। दिन में 37.9 डिग्री रहा था, जो 22 फरवरी 2006 को दर्ज हुआ था। इंदौर में साल 2001 में पूरे महीने करीब दो इंच बारिश भी हो चुकी है। ग्वालियर में रातें ठंडी रहीग्वालियर में तेज ठंड का ट्रेंड रहता है। इसकी वजह यहां सीधे उत्तरी हवाएं आना है। वर्ष 2018 में 1.9 डिग्री, 2019 में 2.4 डिग्री, 2022 में 2.9 डिग्री और 2023 में पारा 2.3 डिग्री तक पहुंच चुका है। 10 साल में एक बार भी पारा 7 डिग्री से ज्यादा नहीं रहा। इस बार भी फरवरी में ऐसा ही मौसम
