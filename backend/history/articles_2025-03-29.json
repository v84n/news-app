            "description": "Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) star batter Virat Kohli could not contain his happiness as the team ended 17-year winless drought against Chennai Super Kings (CSK) at their rivals fortress, Chepauk Stadium on Friday, March 29. Royal Challengers Bengaluru registered a 50-run win over Chennai Super Kings to put an end to their winless streak at the Chepauk. The last time RCB won the match against CSK in Chennai was in 2008, defeating their rivals by 14 runs. After posting a total of 196/8, thanks to fifty by skipper Rajat Patidar and Tim David’s late cameo knock, RCB restricted to 146/8 in 20 overs. Josh Hazlewood led the bowling attack with figures of 3/21, while Yash Dayal and Liam Livingstone picked two wickets. Also read: IPL 2025: Hazlewood hails RCB's adaptability, praises Yash Dayal after dominant win over CSK Royal Challengers Bengaluru players were ecstatic as they finally invaded Chennai Super Kings’ fortress after 17 long years. Virat Kohli was the happiest among them as he became the first RCB player to be part of two wins against Chennai Super Kings at Chepauk. In a video posted by RCB on its social media handles, Kohli and his teammates can be seen grooving to Hanumankind’s blockbuster album ‘Run it up’ to celebrate the team’s Chepauk breach. WATCH: Virat Kohli dancing in dressing room A win so special, it got King Kohli grooving... 😍 This team! The vibes! We’re loving it. ❤ 🎧: Hanumankind (Run it Up)#PlayBold #ನಮ್ಮRCB #IPL2025 #CSKvRCB pic.twitter.com/qmjASYMVFf — Royal Challengers Bengaluru (@RCBTweets) March 29, 2025 Chasing a 197-run target, Chennai Super Kings suffered early blows as they lost four wickets for 54 runs in 8.5 overs. Rachin Ravindra stood tall for the side as he played a valiant innings of 41 off 31 balls to stabilize the CSK’s batting. Yash Dayal inflicted further damage on the hosts’ batting as he picked two wickets of Rachin and Shivam Dube (19) in the 13th over. After Chennai Super Kings were reduced to 99/7 after Ravichandran Ashwin’s dismissal, MS Dhoni walked out to bat. However, it was too late as CSK needed 98 off 28 balls to win the match. However, Dhoni’s late cameo unbeaten knock of 30 off 16 balls, smashing two sixes and a four reduced the margin of defeat, but it was not enough as RCB sealed historic 50-run victory at Chepauk. Virat Kohli’s performance in IPL 2025 Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) star batter Virat Kohli had a great start to his IPL 2025 campaign as he played a match-winning innings of 59 off 36 balls to help the team chase down the 175-run target set by the defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders in the season opener at the Eden Gardens Stadium in Kolkata. However, in the second match against Chennai Super Kings, the 36-year-old struggled to get on on a spin track. He was struggling to play against spin and pace as he scored a scratchy 31 off 30 balls before he was dismissed by Nood Ahmad. Kohli’s performance with the bat on a traditional spin surface at Chepauk raised concerns about his ability to accelerate against quality spin bowling. In IPL 2025 so far, Virat Kohli has aggregated 90 runs, including a fifty, at an average of 90 in two matches. Kohli will look to come up with goods when Royal Challengers Bengaluru take on Gujarat Titans at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on April 2.

According to reports, primordial black holes that existed in the early universe could have evaporated through Hawking radiation, impacting matter distribution. The research explores how these black holes might have shaped galaxies and cosmic structures. Although no direct evidence has been found, scientists believe future observations could confirm their role in cosmology and particle physics.",

The victims from the country's north were killed in the Uromi area of Edo State after being stopped by local security personnel. During a search of their vehicle, officers discovered locally made weapons, and that triggered the attack by the mob, Edo police spokesperson Moses Yamu said in a statement. Videos shared on social media showed the victims being brutalized before they were eventually set on fire with worn-out vehicle tires.",

            "description": "पूर्वांचल...20 से ज्यादा जिलों का समूह। जब भी इसकी बात होती है, आंखों के सामने बाहुबली, गैंगस्टर और माफिया घूमने लगते हैं। एक से बढ़कर एक अपराधी और उनका ऊंचा सियासी कद। मर्डर ऐसे हुए कि विधायक के शरीर को गोलियों से भर दिया गया। फिलहाल, आतंक का यह चैप्टर बंद हो गया। वर्चस्व की लड़ाई खत्म हो गई है। नई पीढ़ी माफियागीरी को साइड रखकर सियासत में उतरी है। अब सवाल है...पूर्वांचल की जो सियासत कभी गाजीपुर और मऊ से चलती थी, उसका सेंटर अब कहां है? आज इस पर बात इसलिए, क्योंकि मुख्तार अंसारी की मौत को एक साल हो गए हैं। क्या कुछ बदल गया? किसका उभार हुआ, किसका पतन। सियासत किस करवट बैठ रही? आज इन्हीं सवालों के जवाब जानेंगे। पहले थोड़ा पीछे चलते हैं, फिर आज की बात और आखिर में भविष्य की बात करेंगे... पूर्वांचल के विकास की योजनाओं ने बाहुबली जन्मे 1970 के दशक में केंद्र सरकार और यूपी सरकार ने पूर्वांचल के विकास के लिए तमाम योजनाएं शुरू कीं। योजनाएं आईं तो ठेकेदार भी आए। ठेकेदारी के साथ दबंगई भी आई। जो जितना अधिक दबंग, उसे उतना ज्यादा मलाईदार ठेका। इन्हीं ठेकों के लिए संघर्ष शुरू हुआ। उन दिनों पूर्वांचल में दो गैंग थे। एक मकनु सिंह गैंग और दूसरा साहिब सिंह गैंग। मुख्तार अंसारी अपने कॉलेज के दोस्त साधु सिंह के साथ मकनु सिंह गैंग में शामिल हुए। पूर्वांचल में बाहुबलियों का नाम आता है, तो ब्रजेश सिंह का भी जिक्र होता है। ब्रजेश उस वक्त साहिब सिंह गैंग में थे। मुख्तार और ब्रजेश में किसी तरह का कोई आपसी विवाद नहीं था, लेकिन गैंग के चलते दोनों ने एक-दूसरे को दुश्मन माना और 1990 आते-आते दोनों एक दूसरे के जानी दुश्मन बन गए। इसी दौरान ब्रजेश की गैंग में त्रिभुवन सिंह शामिल हुआ। त्रिभुवन मुख्तार का दुश्मन हुआ करता था। दोनों मिले तो गैंग में वर्चस्व की लड़ाई शुरू हुई। ठेका रेलवे के स्क्रैप का हो, शराब का हो या फिर कोई किडनैपिंग का मामला। दोनों गैंग हमेशा एक दूसरे के सामने आ जाते। दो मामले जहां मुख्तार और ब्रजेश की दुश्मनी कट्टर हो गई गैंगवार के बाद चुनावी जंग शुरू हुई 90 के दशक में यूपी की राजनीति में स्थिरता नहीं थी। सपा-बसपा और बीजेपी बराबर पर खड़े थे। कांग्रेस पिछड़ रही थी। उस वक्त मुख्तार अंसारी ने बसपा जॉइन की और मऊ सीट पर बीजेपी के विजय प्रताप सिंह को 26 हजार वोट से हराकर विधायक बन गया। इस जीत के बाद मुख्तार की शक्ति और संपत्ति दोनों में इजाफा हो गया। विधायक बनने के बाद ठेका लेने और दिलवाने में दिक्कत खत्म हो गई। मुख्तार गैंगस्टर से रॉबिनहुड बनने की तरफ बढ़ गया। किसी की बेटी की शादी हो, किसी की तेरहवीं हो, मुख्तार के फाटक पर पहुंचो और पैसा लेकर जाओ। मुख्तार अंसारी का जहां घर है, वह गाजीपुर की मोहम्मदाबाद सीट लगती है। यहां पर 1985 से ही अंसारी परिवार का कब्जा रहा है। आज भी है। 2002 में बीजेपी नेता कृष्णानंद राय ने मुख्तार के बड़े भाई अफजाल अंसारी को 7 हजार 7 सौ 72 वोट से हरा दिया। 25 नवंबर 2005 को कृष्णानंद राय की गाड़ी पर हमला हो गया। हमला AK-47 से हुआ। कृष्णानंद राय समेत कुल 7 लोग मारे गए। पोस्टमॉर्टम हुआ तो सातों के शरीर से 67 गोलियां मिलीं। कृष्णानंद राय की गाड़ी के पीछे वाली गाड़ी पर बैठे उनके भाई रामनारायण राय कहते हैं, मारने वाले कह रहे थे, ‘मारो इसको, इन लोगों ने भाई को बहुत परेशान कर रखा है।’ लोग बताते हैं कि ये भाई कोई और नहीं बल्कि मुख्तार अंसारी था। कृष्णानंद की पत्नी अलका राय ने मुख्तार अंसारी, अफजाल अंसारी, अतहर रहमान उर्फ बाबू, मुन्ना बजरंगी, संजीव महेश्वरी उर्फ जीवा के खिलाफ मामला दर्ज किया। उस वक्त मुख्तार का खौफ ऐसा था कि एसपी ने जांच करने से मना कर दिया था। कोई जेल में तो कोई कोर्ट में मारा गया पूर्वांचल में अंसारी परिवार के दबदबे को कुछ ऐसे समझिए...। अलका चाहती थीं कि उनके पति की हत्या का केस सीबीआई देखे। सीबीआई यह केस नहीं लेना चाहती थी। दबाव बढ़ा तो ले लिया, लेकिन एक साल बाद ही छोड़ दिया। अलका ने दोबारा मामला दर्ज करवाया। उसी दौरान चश्मदीद शशिकांत राय की हत्या कर दी गई। 2005 में ‘ए’ कैटेगरी के बड़े ठेकेदार अजय प्रकाश सिंह उर्फ मन्ना की हत्या हुई। इस मामले के चश्मदीद मन्ना के मुनीम राम सिंह मौर्य को सुरक्षा मिली। एक साल बाद राम सिंह और उनके गनर को भी गोली मारकर मौत के घाट उतार दिया गया। इन घटनाओं से लोगों के मन में डर बैठ गया। मुख्तार ने अपना ठिकाना जेल को बनाया। इसलिए कई केसों में उसका नाम डायरेक्ट नहीं आया। 2017 में जब बीजेपी की सरकार बनी तो चीजें बदल गईं। डॉन मुन्ना बजरंगी की बागपत जेल में हत्या हो गई। संजीव महेश्वरी उर्फ जीवा की कोर्ट में हत्या कर दी गई और 2024 में मुख्तार अंसारी की बांदा जेल में मौत हो गई। इस तरह से पूर्वांचल की सियासत में क्राइम का एक चैप्टर खत्म हो गया। पूर्वांचल में अब ब्रजेश सिंह का दबदबा इन तीन तस्वीरों में देखिए ब्रजेश सिंह का रसूख मुख्तार की मौत के पहले तक पूर्वांचल की सियासत में बाहुबली ब्रजेश सिंह पर्दे के पीछे रहते थे, वह अब आगे आ गए हैं। इसकी पहली बानगी उनके बेटे की शादी में दिखती है। इसी मार्च महीने में ब्रजेश ने अपने छोटे बेटे सागर सिंह की शादी की। शादी गोवा में हुई और उसका रिसेप्शन बनारस में हुआ। इस रिसेप्शन में आसपास के जितने बाहुबली नेता थे, सभी पहुंचे। इसमें ब्रजभूषण सिंह, धनंजय सिंह, रघुराज प्रताप सिंह भी शामिल रहे। यूपी सरकार के डिप्टी सीएम ब्रजेश पाठक समेत करीब 10 से ज्यादा मंत्री और 20 से ज्यादा विधायक रिसेप्शन में शामिल हुए। ऐसा नहीं कि ब्रजेश सिंह का राजनीतिक रसूख पहले नहीं था। ब्रजेश के बड़े भाई उदय सिंह उर्फ चुलबुल सिंह दो बार एमएलसी रह चुके हैं। भतीजे सुशील सिंह इस वक्त विधायक हैं। सुशील की पत्नी और भाई जिला पंचायत अध्यक्ष रह चुके हैं। ब्रजेश खुद भी 2016 में निर्दलीय जीते। उस वक्त बीजेपी ने समर्थन किया तो उसकी बड़ी आलोचना हुई थी। इसी वजह से 2022 में ब्रजेश की पत्नी अन्नपूर्णा सिंह जब प्रत्याशी बनीं तो उनके सामने बीजेपी ने सुदामा पटेल को प्रत्याशी बनाया। लेकिन जीत अन्नपूर्णा की हुई। बीजेपी का समर्थन प्राप्त हमने पॉलिटिकल एक्सपर्ट मुलायम सिंह यादव से पूर्वांचल की राजनीति को लेकर बात की। वह 2022 के एमएलसी चुनाव से ही बात की शुरुआत करते हैं। कहते हैं, यूपी में 36 सीटों पर चुनाव हुआ। 33 बीजेपी जीती। जिन तीन जगहों पर हारी, वहां बीजेपी ने खुद अपने कैंडिडेट को हरवाया। वाराणसी में ब्रजेश की पत्नी को 4234 वोट मिले और बीजेपी को मात्र 170 वोट। यह कैसे हो सकता है। स्वाभाविक है कि बीजेपी के वोटर्स यहां दूसरी तरफ गए हैं। मुलायम सिंह यादव कहते हैं, धनंजय सिंह की पत्नी पिछले साल लोकसभा चुनाव में जौनपुर सीट से बीजेपी प्रत्याशी बनीं, फिर अचानक वापस हो गईं। पार्टी में एकजुटता भले न हो, लेकिन पूर्वांचल में ठाकुर जाति में एकजुटता बहुत है। सरकार की नीतियों ने पूर्वांचल को बदला पूर्वांचल की राजनीति में बदलाव को लेकर हमने वाराणसी में बीएचयू के प्रोफेसर तेज प्रताप सिंह से बात की। वह कहते हैं, आज स्थिति यह है कि खुलेआम न तो किसी की किडनैपिंग हो रही और न ही किसी से वसूली मांगी जा रही। प्रशासन और कानून अपने स्तर पर मजबूत हुए हैं। तेज प्रताप सिंह मौजूदा स्थिति को लेकर बिना किसी का नाम लिए कहते हैं, ‘आज जो पूर्वांचल की राजनीति में केंद्र में हैं, वह भी अब न किसी की किडनैपिंग कर रहे और न ही किसी को धमकाकर पैसा मांग रहे। वह लोग तो अब खबरों से भी गायब रहना ठीक समझते हैं। अब गैंग भी नहीं कि एक दूसरे के गैंग पर हमला किया जाए। मैं फिर से कह रहा हूं कि प्रशासन स्तर पर अच्छा काम हुआ, जिसकी वजह से चीजें बदल रही हैं।’ जातियों में बंटा है पूरा क्षेत्र हम पूर्वांचल के अलग-अलग जिलों में तीन दिन रहे। हमें गाजीपुर में पूर्वांचल एक्सप्रेस-वे के पास किसान मनोहर राय मिले। वह कहते हैं, यहां जाति सबसे महत्वपूर्ण है। जैसे मैं भूमिहार जाति का हूं और बीजेपी का समर्थक हूं तो मेरी जाति के खिलाफ वाले लोग दूसरी पार्टी में चले जाएंगे। क्योंकि उन्हें लोकल स्तर पर दुश्मनी निभानी है। उसे उन्हें डाउन करना है। यह सिर्फ गाजीपुर में नहीं है, हम बलिया से हैं, वहां भी यही स्थिति है। लोकसभा चुनाव में सपा से सनातन पांडेय के आ जाने से लोग जातियों में ही बंट गए। हमें कारोबारी मयंक कुमार राय मिले। वह कहते हैं, पूर्वांचल की राजनीति में गुंडाराज खत्म हो गया है। विकास का मुद्दा सबसे आगे है। जहां तक ब्रजेश सिंह की बात है तो उनका इलाका बनारस है, गाजीपुर की जनता अपने मन से आगे बढ़ती है। वह किसी की नहीं सुनती। बाकी जातिवाद तो यहां खूब है, मुख्तार अंसारी का परिवार यहां इसलिए जीत रहा था, क्योंकि यादव-मुस्लिम एक जुट होकर उनके साथ रहते थे। बसपा ने इस साल उमेश सिंह को प्रत्याशी बनाया था। बहुत अच्छे नेता हैं, लेकिन जातिवाद के चलते नहीं जीत पाए। -------------------- ये खबर भी पढ़ें... यूपी का पहला डिजिटल हाईवे कैसा
