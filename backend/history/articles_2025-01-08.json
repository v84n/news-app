His arrest followed critical comments Qaradawi made of the UAE, Saudi Arabian and Egyptian authorities in a video posted online.The UAE and Egypt have both filed requests for his extradition. The requests \"are believed to be based on the legitimate exercise of his right to freedom of expression,\" Amnesty International's Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa, Sara Hashash said in a statement on Tuesday, urging Lebanese authorities to reject the extradition requests.The Egyptian and Emirati foreign ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Qaradawi's lawyer said he would file an urgent appeal to block his extradition on Wednesday morning but feared his client might be flown out of the country before then.",

            "description": "Germany News: A German couple has been charged with the murder of a Ukrainian refugee and her mother, as well as the kidnapping of the refugee's newborn daughter, whom the couple allegedly planned to pass off as their own child. The charges were announced on Tuesday in a Mannheim court, news agency AFP reported.The accused, a 44-year-old German woman and her 43-year-old husband, are alleged to have killed the 27-year-old Ukrainian refugee and her 51-year-old mother in March. Prosecutors revealed that the couple's motive stemmed from a \"long-unfulfilled wish to have a daughter\".According to a DW report, the couple confessed to the killings because they wanted to take the 27-year-old's baby. The prosecutors' statement detailed a chilling series of events, starting with the couple's plan to kidnap a newborn baby and claim her as their own. Couple Joined Telegram Group To Trap The Victims To execute their scheme, the 44-year-old woman reportedly joined a Telegram group aimed at providing support to Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion. Through the group, the couple connected with the Ukrainian refugee, who was seeking translation assistance before the birth of her child earlier this year, the AFP report said.According to the prosecution, the two families met in March for a meal at a restaurant, during which the German couple allegedly spiked the drinks of the Ukrainian woman and her mother with sedatives. When the 51-year-old woman fell ill, the German couple offered to drive her to the hospital while also promising to take the younger woman and her newborn daughter home.However, according to prosecutors, the German man instead drove the older woman to a fishing lake, where he struck her at least four times with an unidentified object before disposing of her body in the water. The couple then deceived the younger Ukrainian woman, telling her that her mother had suffered a heart attack and was in hospital.They drove the 27-year-old and her infant daughter to a secluded area near the Rhine River in Hockenheim, the report said. Still under the effects of the sedatives, the young mother was killed with \"at least three\" blows to the head. Prosecutors allege the couple then set her body on fire before leaving with her newborn daughter.The couple is currently in custody pending trial and faces charges of double murder, with one count linked to the abduction of a minor. Authorities described the crime as a calculated and brutal act, rooted in the couple's desperation to fulfill their wish for a child.",

Top of off, bails flying, and that swung back in as well, wow.\"Watch the video here:Beautiful swing from Arshdeep Singh pic.twitter.com/hhFX2WzHlz— Rothesay County Championship (@CountyChamp) January 7, 2025While the video is from 2023, it has sparked fresh discussions amongst the social media users about Arshdeep’s absence in the Indian squad for BGT, with one user noting, “I don't understand why BCCI is ignoring him in tests and odis. Man delivered in back to back T20 wcs and also the highest wicket taker of 2024 T20 wc.”Here’s a look at some of the other comments under the post:Why was he not in BGT.— Only Option - Trader (@WithOnlyOption) January 7, 2025@prasannalara why bcci not selected arshdeep Singh 🧐— Immanuel sam (@Immanuelsam12) January 7, 2025@Divya06317132 Isnt this guy is swinging the heck out of the cherry and he could have come very handy downunder along Bumrah ? Why we don't play a bowler to in test cricket by judging his performance in ODIs ,like Arshdeep ?— Aurora (@Rahat1314823) January 7, 2025Why this guy is not playing test matches is beyond my imagination. Left handed, fast, natural swing. Will be a great option with red ball.— Himanshu Ritakshi (@HimanshuRitaksh) January 7, 2025",

            "description": "Garena Free Fire Max redeem codes for today: Garena Free Fire Max, the follow-up to the immensely popular Garena Free Fire, has become a favourite among Indian gamers, especially after the original title was banned by the Indian government in 2022. This newer version has captivated players with its enhanced graphics and rich gameplay experience. Adding to its allure, 111 Dot Studios, the developers, regularly release free redeem codes, enabling players to claim in-game rewards such as unique skins, diamonds, weapons, and other items at no cost.Garena Free Fire Max redeem codes are 12-character alphanumeric combinations made up of uppercase letters and numbers. By redeeming these codes, players can access a range of in-game perks, such as character upgrades, weapon skins, and other exclusive items. This approach not only enhances player engagement but also serves as a clever marketing strategy by fostering a sense of urgency and excitement within the battle royale gaming community.Keep in mind that these redeem codes are time-sensitive, typically valid for only 12 hours, and limited to the first 500 users who claim them. To ensure you don’t miss out, it’s crucial to act promptly and secure your rewards before the codes expire.Garena Free Fire Exclusive Rewards & Limited AvailabilityGarena has launched a special redemption website where players can grab exclusive in-game rewards. Prizes include fan favourites like the Rebel Academy Weapon Loot Crate, Revolt Weapon Loot Crate, and the coveted Diamond Voucher. The Fire Head Hunting Parachute has become particularly popular, sparking a rush among players eager to claim it.However, these rewards come with tight restrictions — only 500 redemptions are allowed daily, and players have just a 12-hour window to claim their items. This limited availability has heightened competition among gamers looking to score some of the game’s most sought-after upgrades.Garena Free Fire Max Redeem Codes For January 8, 2025FFPSYKMXTP2H: Pushpa Bundle + Glue Wall SkinFY9MFW7KFSNN: Cobra BundleFW2KQX9MFFPS: Pushpa Voice PackFFPSTXV5FRDM: Pushpa Emote – Hargiz Jhukega Nahi Plus Gloo Wall – Fire Hai MainFXK2NDY5QSMX: Yellow Poker MP40 Flashing SpadeVY2KFXT9FQNC: Golden Grace ShotgunXF4SWKCH6KY4: LOL EmoteYFW2Y7NQFV9S: Cobra MP40 Skin + 1450 TokensFFW4FST9FQY2: Bunny Warrior BundleFTY7FGN4XKHC: Legendary Frostfire Polar BundleHow To Redeem Garena Free Fire Max CodesHere's how to access and redeem the codes:Access the official Rewards Redeem website for Garena Free Fire Max using Google Chrome or your preferred browserSign in to your account via Facebook, X, Google, or VK IDCopy the codes provided above and paste them into the designated text boxClick on Confirm to proceed.

            "description": "समस्तीपुर जिले के गोला रोड स्थित बैंक ऑफ बड़ौदा शाखा में गोल्ड लोन के मामले में बड़ा फर्जीवाड़ा सामने आया है। बैंक द्वारा सोने की जांच के लिए नियुक्त पैनल स्वर्ण जांच कर्ता की मिलीभगत से 72 लोगों ने नकली सोना जमा कर करीब डेढ़ करोड़ रुपए का गोल्ड लोन ले लिया। बैंक के रिव्यू के दौरान जब सोने की जांच की गई, तो पता चला कि इन 72 लोन धारकों ने नकली सोना देकर लोन हासिल किया था। इस फर्जीवाड़े का खुलासा होने के बाद बैंक के सहायक महाप्रबंधक राजीव कुमार चौधरी के बयान पर नगर थाने में प्राथमिकी दर्ज कराई गई है। प्राथमिकी में पैनल में शामिल स्वर्ण जांचकर्ता अमरजीत शाह और 72 लोन धारकों को आरोपी बनाया गया है। घटना के बाद, नकली सोना देकर लोन लेने वाले लोगों के बीच हड़कंप मच गया है। इसके साथ ही बैंक के वरीय अधिकारियों की टीम भी शाखा पहुंचकर मामले की आंतरिक जांच कर रही है। जांच के दौरान मामला का खुलासा बैंक अधिकारियों ने बताया कि समय-समय पर स्वर्ण आभूषणों का पुनर्निर्धारण अन्य शाखाओं के अधिकारियों द्वारा किया जाता है। वित्तीय वर्ष 2022-23 में लिए गए गोल्ड लोन के तहत जमा किए गए सोने की जांच की गई। इस दौरान 10 लोगों द्वारा जमा किए गए सोने का जांच किया गया, जो सभी नकली पाए गए। जिसके बाद बैंक ने सभी गोल्ड लोन धारकों के सोने की जांच कराई। जिसमें से 72 लोगों का सोना नकली निकला। इस मामले के खुलासे के बाद बैंक अधिकारियों ने सहायक महाप्रबंधक के नेतृत्व में प्राथमिकी दर्ज कराई और विभागीय जांच शुरू की। कैसे हुआ घोटाला बैंक अधिकारियों ने बताया कि बैंक ऑफ बड़ौदा की गोल्ड लोन योजना के तहत, बैंक सोने के मूल्य का 75% तक लोन देता है। बैंक ने सोने की जांच करने के लिए पैनल में स्वर्ण कारोबारी अमरजीत शाह को नियुक्त किया था, जो मुफस्सिल थाना क्षेत्र के शंभू पट्टी का निवासी है। फर्जीवाड़ा से जुड़ी मिली जानकारी के अनुसार, लोन लेने वाले लोगों ने स्वर्ण जांच कर्ता के साथ मिलकर नकली सोने को असली बताकर रिपोर्ट में उसे सही दिखाया और इसके बाद लोन स्वीकृत करवा लिया। अधिकतर लोन एक से दो लाख रुपए तक के थे। मामले में बैंककर्मियों की मिलीभगत पर जांच इस मामले में एएसपी संजय पांडे ने बताया कि नकली सोना देकर लोन लेने का मामला सामने आने के बाद बैंक ऑफ बड़ौदा के सहायक महाप्रबंधक के बयान पर नगर थाने में प्राथमिकी दर्ज की गई है। इसमें बैंक के पैनल स्वर्ण जांच कर्ता और 72 लोन धारकों को आरोपी बनाया गया है। पुलिस ने कहा कि मामले की जांच चल रही है और जल्द ही आरोपितों की गिरफ्तारी की जाएगी। साथ ही यह भी देखा जा रहा है कि कहीं बैंक के कर्मियों की मिलीभगत तो नहीं है। अगर ऐसा पाया गया, तो उनके खिलाफ भी कार्रवाई की जाएगी।",

Over the past few weeks, Trump has asserted that he wants to make Canada part of the United States and its 51st state. Many times, he has been mocking Trudeau as the Governor of Canada.(I will be using) economic force because Canada and the United States, that would really be something. You get rid of that artificially drawn line and you take a look at what that looks like, and it would also be much better for national security. Don't forget, we basically protect Canada, Trump said.Trudeau, who resigned as the prime minister of Canada a day earlier, responded sharply on social media. There isn't a snowball's chance in hell that Canada would become part",

In a surprising development, two U.S. citizens were arrested in Venezuela as part of a group of seven accused of being 'mercenaries' by President Nicolas Maduro. The incident unfolds as Maduro readies himself for inauguration amid controversial election claims.Maduro described the U.S. detainees as 'very high level' but offered no substantial evidence or details regarding their capture. A total of 125 foreign mercenaries from 25 countries are reportedly held, raising human rights concerns about arbitrary detentions in the politically volatile nation.Meanwhile, opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez, recognized as president-elect by several countries, challenges the official election results, adding to the international political friction. The U.S. and global communities watch closely as power dynamics shift in Venezuela.",

            "description": "Inferno in Pacific Palisades: High Winds Fuel Devastating Wildfire A raging wildfire swept through Pacific Palisades in Los Angeles on Tuesday, leading to widespread evacuations and panic. Around 30,000 residents were forced to flee as the fire consumed over 1,262 acres, driven by powerful winds and dry conditions that local authorities had warned about earlier.The blaze spread rapidly overnight, raising fears of more evacuations. Residents described harrowing escapes as flying embers ignited vegetation near homes and along key roads like Sunset Boulevard. The Los Angeles Fire Department, aided by aerial water drops, battled the inferno threatening numerous neighborhoods.Traffic chaos ensued with only a few routes available for escape. The National Weather Service had issued extreme fire condition alerts, forecasting significant wind gusts. Governor Newsom emphasized mobilizing firefighting resources, anticipating multiple fires due to the unforgiving weather. The situation remains precarious with potential for additional outbreaks.",

            "description": "We may no longer be at the height of the tiny home craze, but the idea of a resource-light, efficiently built home that can be plonked down just about anywhere still appeals. Today at CES, I got to tour the 2025 model of the microhaus Pro from California-based Haus. It was shiny, swankily appointed and, honestly, not as expensive as I thought it'd be. The interior of the 120-square foot unit is all wood tones, glass and soft neutrals. It's like you took a shipping container and replaced the hard lines and corrugated steel with rounded corners and floor-to-ceiling windows. The surfaces glint and every part of the space is maximized with an Ikea-like small-space efficiency, like the queen-sized Murphy bed that folds up to reveal a table and two bench seats. The kitchen has a small fridge, microwave and included in the price is a full suite of Villeroy & Boch dishware and there's a full-sized shower in the bathroom. The units truly can go just about anywhere with no site preparation required — if the ground is flat, it'll work. The microhaus Pro is also climate agnostic, with the ability to set up in snowy forests, hot deserts and temperate beaches (though hot and cold climate packages are about $10,00 extra each). It's also seismic California fire code and CAT-5 hurricane compliant. Amy Skorheim / Engadget Installation takes usually under an hour and doesn't require any special hook ups — a garden hose and an extension cord is all it needs. And thanks to its size, it falls below the size threshold that would require a permit. The included 3.6 kWh battery can run everything in the home for four days and there's an optional atmospheric water generation and a battery life of four days. Drinking water is reverse osmosis filtered and the waste disposal system \"melts\" everything into liquid, which can be run out an extendable pipe you can connect to septic or a holding tank. The Pro model also features high-end perks like voice control via the Apple HomePod mounted to the wall. During my tour, Max Gerbut, Haus's CEO asked Siri to lower the shades, and it complied. You also get the full package, dishes, towels et cetera — I even saw a drawer full of M&Ms in the kitchen and was assured you get those too. The Pro model is a more deluxe and robust edition meant for Airbnb and rental use and goes for $89,99. If you don't need the smart home features, the battery backup and the included dishes, you can grab the microhaus Lite for $59,990. There's also a $35,000 shell version that includes just the HVAC system, lights, wiring, bathroom fixtures and plumbing. One thing none of the microhaus models include is solar generation. For that, you'll need to switch up to the 400 and 800 square-foot units. Those have the same put-it-anywhere convenience but are fully autonomous and go for $199,000 and $299,000, respectively. Note that none of the prices include delivery. It's true — none of these prices are small numbers. But I've helped build yurts, tiny homes and sheds. I've lived in more than one hand-built home and have looked into many other modular, pre-fab options. Comparatively, these prices aren't terribly high, especially when you consider there's nearly no site prep, no installation and no contractor required. The microhaus Pro is available to order now from the Haus website.
