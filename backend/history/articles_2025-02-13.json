            "description": "PM Modi Trump Meeting Live: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday, marking their first meeting since Trump took office. Trade, tariffs, and defence cooperation will be key topics as both leaders seek to strengthen U.S.-India ties. Modi is expected to offer trade concessions, including lower tariffs on American goods and increased imports of U.S. energy and defence equipment, in an effort to ease trade tensions. The Trump administration has pushed for more reciprocal trade policies, citing concerns over India’s high import duties. Beyond trade, discussions will cover defence procurement, immigration policies, and India’s strategic role in countering China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific. With Modi’s visit shaping the future of U.S.-India relations, the outcome could have significant implications for trade, security, and global diplomacy. Stay tuned to our live blog for real-time updates on the meeting.",

To prevent disproportionate taxation on those earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh, the government has introduced marginal relief, significantly reducing tax burdens for middle-income earners.

'डेडपूल 2' में भी शाहरुख खान की लोकप्रियता का आलम देखने को मिला. निर्देशक डेविड लीच ने 'डेडपूल 2' के हिंदी वर्जन को पूरी तरह भारतीय स्टाइल देने की कोशिश की और हिंदी फैंस से जोड़ने के लिए फिल्म में शाहरुख खान की फिल्म 'स्वदेश' का गाना 'यूं ही चला चल' भी शामिल किया गया.वहीं अब एंथनी मैकी के इस बयान के बाद सोशल मीडिया पर चर्चाओं का बाजार गर्म है कि शायद मार्वल और शाहरुख खान के बीच किसी प्रोजेक्ट को लेकर बातचीत चल रही है. अब देखनेवाली बात होगी कि क्या 'कैप्टन अमेरिका' एंथनी मैकी की शाहरुख खान को एवेंजर्स में शामिल करने की ये इच्छा पूरी होगी.वर्कफ्रंट की बात करें तो शाहरुख खान इन दिनों अपनी आने वाली फिल्म किंग की तैयारियों में लगे हुए हैं. किंग को सिद्धार्थ आनंद डायरेक्ट कर रहे हैं. इस फिल्म में शाहरुख खान के साथ सुहाना खान अहम किरदार निभाती नजर आएंगी.ये भी पढ़ें: TV TRP Report: ‘अनुपमा’ ने मारी बाजी, ‘सेलिब्रिटी मास्टर शेफ’ को लगा तगड़ा झटका, देखें टॉप शोज की टीआरपी रिपोर्ट",

The company will list the division in Amsterdam, London, and New York, a decision that signals a significant change in strategy.The move comes as part of Unilever's efforts to regain investor confidence after years of lackluster performance in its ice cream sector. The company had revealed these plans last year, emphasizing the need to streamline operations and focus on more profitable ventures.By making its ice cream business an independent entity, Unilever aims to unlock value and propel growth. This strategic step is expected to provide the necessary boost to rejuvenate investor interest and enhance the company's overall market standing.",

            "description": "The recent proceedings in the Rajya Sabha saw intense discussions regarding the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) report on the Waqf Amendment Bill 2024. The report, which was presented to the house, ignited strong reactions from the opposition, leading to a significant disruption of the proceedings. As a result, the session had to be adjourned until 11:20 AM due to the uproar. The report outlined the findings and deliberations on the bill, a matter of considerable importance in the current political landscape. However, the opposition expressed its discontent, citing issues related to the management of Waqf properties, land allocation, and the lack of adequate health centers and educational institutions for the Muslim community. Many felt that these resources should be prioritized for the marginalized sections of society, particularly underprivileged Muslims who could benefit from more accessible public services. Despite the tension, the government remained firm on its stance regarding the bill and its associated amendments. The ongoing debate underscores the deep divisions within the house and the challenges in reaching a consensus on crucial national policies, particularly concerning religious and minority welfare.",

            "description": "India's Fielding Frenzy Shines in ODI Series Against England Fielding excellence was on full display as India completed a clean sweep against England in their recent ODI series. T Dilip, the Indian fielding coach, expressed immense satisfaction over the team's remarkable performances, which included phenomenal catches and strategic run-outs.The highlight of the series was Shreyas Iyer's exceptional fielding, earning him the prestigious 'Impact Fielder' medal. Iyer's decisive run-out of England's Phil Salt in the first match was a turning point that underscored India's robust fielding strategy under Dilip's guidance.According to Dilip, the fielding efforts were consistently superior, with players like Harshit Rana and Shubman Gill making critical contributions. These outstanding feats helped India secure a 142-run victory and were a testament to the team's composure and fielding prowess throughout the series.",

            "description": "केंद्र सरकार ने बुधवार (12 फरवरी, 2025) को सुप्रीम कोर्ट को सूचित किया कि उसने हाल में एकीकृत पेंशन योजना (UPS) को अधिसूचित किया है, जिससे न्यायिक अधिकारियों की चिंताओं का समाधान हो सकता है. जस्टिस भूषण रामाकृष्ण गवई और जस्टिस ऑगस्टीन जॉर्ज मसीह की पीठ ने केंद्र के वकील की दलीलें सुनीं.एकीकृत पेंशन योजना नियोक्ता-आधारित पेंशन योजना है जिसमें सामाजिक सुरक्षा को कर्मचारियों के कुल लाभ के हिस्से के रूप में गिना जाता है. केंद्र की ओर से अटॉर्नी जनरल आर. वेंकटरमणी और सॉलिसिटर जनरल तुषार मेहता पेश हुए और पीठ को एकीकृत पेंशन योजना के बारे में जानकारी दी.यह मामला जिला न्यायपालिका के अधिकारियों के लिए नयी पेंशन योजना की प्रयोज्यता से संबंधित है. पीठ ने कहा, 'अटॉर्नी जनरल और सॉलिसिटर जनरल का कहना है कि एकीकृत पेंशन योजना न्यायिक अधिकारियों समेत सभी कर्मचारियों की चिंताओं का समाधान कर सकती है.'कोर्ट ने कहा कि इसलिए न्यायालय ने यह उचित समझा कि मामले को कुछ समय के लिए स्थगित कर दिया जाए ताकि यह देखा जा सके कि एकीकृत पेंशन योजना किस प्रकार काम करती है और फिर संबंधित मुद्दों पर निर्णय लिया जा सके. मामले की सुनवाई 12 सप्ताह बाद होगी.यह मामला जिला न्यायपालिका के अधिकारियों और हाईकोर्ट के रिटायर्ड को पेंशन के वितरण पर चिंता को लेकर है. सुप्रीम कोर्ट जिला न्यायपालिका के अधिकारियों के वेतन, बकाया और भत्तों से संबंधित मामले पर विचार कर रहा है. वित्त मंत्रालय ने 25 जनवरी को यूपीएस को अधिसूचित किया था और इसमें सेवानिवृत्ति से पहले अंतिम 12 महीनों के दौरान प्राप्त औसत मूल वेतन के 50 पर्सेंट के बराबर पेंशन सुनिश्चित करने का वादा किया गया है.वित्त मंत्रालय की ओर से जारी राजपत्र अधिसूचना के अनुसार यूपीएस उन केंद्रीय सरकारी कर्मचारियों पर लागू होगा जो राष्ट्रीय पेंशन प्रणाली (NPS) के अंतर्गत आते हैं और इस प्रणाली के तहत विकल्प चुनते हैं. 25 जनवरी को प्रकाशित अधिसूचना के अनुसार कर्मचारी के सेवा से हटाये जाने या बर्खास्त किये जाने या त्यागपत्र दिये जाने की स्थिति में यूपीएस या सुनिश्चित भुगतान उपलब्ध नहीं होगा.अधिसूचना 23 लाख सरकारी कर्मचारियों को यूपीएस और एनपीएस के बीच चयन करने का विकल्प प्रदान करती है. एनपीएस को एक जनवरी 2004 को लागू किया गया था. यह भी पढ़ें:-Pappu Yadav: 'ये बाबा लोग एक दिन खाना खिलाकर टैक्स में बच...', साधू-संतों को टैक्स छूट पर क्या-क्या बोल गए पप्पू यादव",

Net income increased 45.8% on-year to KRW142.4 billion. In the fourth quarter alone, the company recorded KRW98.2 billion in net sales, KRW46.6 billion in operating profit, and KRW40.7 billion in net income, reflecting year-over-year growth of 10.4%, 26.7%, and 130%, respectively. NET SALES GROWTH DRIVEN BY TOXIN, HA FILLERS, COSMETICS Hugel's botulinum toxin, branded as Botulax in South Korea and globally known as Letybo, achieved KRW203.2 billion in net sales in 2024 with a 20.2% increase on-year. The overseas sales of the botulinum toxin rose 39.6% on-year, fueled by strong performance in major Asia-Pacific markets, shipment to the US, and robust growth in Europe. Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers, branded as THE CHAEUM and BYRYZN in South Korea and globally known as Revolax, achieved KRW127.6 billion in net sales for 2024. The overseas sales of dermal fillers rose 13.2% on-year, led by steady shipments to China and continued growth in Europe and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Hugel focuses on marketing activities for the fillers to increase brand awareness while maintaining leadership in South Korea and expanding its presence in global markets. Hugel's cosmetics business, represented by brands WELLAGE and BYRYZN BR, showed rapid growth last year. Net sales of the cosmetics business jumped 37.8% on-year to KRW36.9 billion in 2024. In the fourth quarter, net sales soared 48.1% on-year to KRW11.7 billion. Hugel is strengthening the cosmetics brand value by releasing the Hyper Peptide series of WELLAGE last August and promoting BYRYZN BR, launched in April 2024. GLOBAL EXPANSION ACCELERATES WITH TOXIN ENTRY IN THE US, MENA, AND OTHER EMERGING MARKETS Hugel will continue to focus on expanding sales and increasing market dominance abroad this year. The company is prioritizing sales and marketing efforts in the US, where it plans to officially launch its botulinum toxin in the first half of the year. Hugel aims to capture 10% of the US medical aesthetics market within three years, differentiating itself through academic events for medical professionals and competitive pricing strategies. Hugel will also accelerate its expansion in MENA, a key emerging market for medical aesthetics. The company targets a 30% share within three years in major markets, including the United Arab Emirates where it obtained a marketing license in January of this year and Kuwait where it has been present for 2.5 years. \"We achieved the highest net sales, operating profit, and net income in 2024 since our inception with significant growth in flagship products such as botulinum toxin and hyaluronic acid fillers and new growth driver cosmetics. We will continue expansion in our new markets, including North America and MENA, while strengthening our leadership position in Asia-Pacific and Europe and solidifying our position as a global industry leader\", a Hugel official said.

            "description": "गाजियाबाद में साप्ताहिक बाजार विवाद को सुलझाने के लिए आज नगर निगम में महत्वपूर्ण बैठक होगी। नगर निगम के सर्वे के अनुसार, वर्तमान में शहर में 65 स्थानों पर साप्ताहिक बाजार लगता है। इनमें वसुंधरा जोन में 24, कवि नगर जोन में 15, मोहन नगर जोन में 8, विजयनगर में 7 और सिटी जोन में 11 बाजार शामिल हैं। बाजार हटाने के विरोध में भाजपा विधायक किशोर गुर्जर ने कड़ा रुख अपनाया था और इसे 2 लाख लोगों की आजीविका से जोड़ा था। मामले की गंभीरता को देखते हुए उत्तर प्रदेश के मुख्य सचिव मनोज सिंह को भी हस्तक्षेप करना पड़ा, जिन्होंने स्पष्ट किया कि नए स्थान चिह्नित होने तक पुराने स्थानों पर ही बाजार लगेंगे। वर्तमान में सड़कों पर लगने वाले इन बाजारों से यातायात जाम की समस्या के साथ-साथ मेडिकल इमरजेंसी में भी दिक्कतें आ रही हैं। आज की बैठक में टाउन वेंडिंग कमेटी का पुनर्गठन भी किया जाएगा और बाजार व्यवस्था को लेकर विस्तृत चर्चा की जाएगी।",

            "description": "ग्रीन वेजिटेबल्स, नट्स, फ्रेश फ्रूट्स और हेल्दी फैट्स से भरपूर डाइट लें। ओमेगा-3 फैटी एसिड्स (अखरोट, अलसी, चिया सीड्स) स्किन के लिए फायदेमंद होते हैं। दिनभर में 8-10 गिलास पानी पीने से टॉक्सिन्स बाहर निकलते हैं और स्किन हेल्दी बनी रहती है। योग, मेडिटेशन और एक्सरसाइज से स्ट्रेस लेवल कंट्रोल में रहता है, जिससे हार्मोन बैलेंस होते हैं। स्किन टाइप के अनुसार क्लींजिंग, मॉइश्चराइजिंग और सनस्क्रीन का इस्तेमाल करें। हार्ड केमिकल वाले प्रोडक्ट्स से बचें। अगर हार्मोनल इम्बैलेंस के कारण स्किन प्रॉब्लम्स बढ़ रही हैं, तो एंडोक्राइनोलॉजिस्ट या डर्मेटोलॉजिस्ट से संपर्क करें। अगर सही लाइफस्टाइल और स्किन केयर फॉलो किया जाए, तो हार्मोनल इम्बैलेंस के कारण होने वाली स्किन समस्याओं को कंट्रोल किया जा सकता है। भास्कर न्यूज| लुधियाना। हार्मोनल इम्बैलेंस सिर्फ हेल्थ को ही नहीं, बल्कि आपकी स्किन को भी प्रभावित करता है। हार्मोन्स में बदलाव के कारण चेहरे पर एक्ने, पिगमेंटेशन, ड्राइनेस, ऑयली स्किन और प्रीमेच्योर एजिंग जैसी समस्याएं देखने को मिलती हैं। खासतौर पर युवाओं, महिलाओं और मिडिल एज ग्रुप के लोगों में यह परेशानी ज्यादा देखने को मिलती है। पीसीओएस, थायरॉइड, स्ट्रेस, खराब लाइफस्टाइल इसके मुख्य कारण हैं। शहर के एक प्रमुख स्किन एक्सपर्ट के मुताबिक जब शरीर में एस्ट्रोजन, प्रोजेस्टेरोन, टेस्टोस्टेरोन या कॉर्टिसोल जैसे हार्मोन्स असंतुलित होते हैं, तो स्किन की ऑयल प्रोडक्शन, इलास्टिसिटी और टेक्सचर पर असर पड़ता है। कुछ लोगों को अचानक से चेहरे पर पिंपल्स की समस्या होती है, तो कुछ को त्वचा का रूखापन या रेडनेस झेलनी पड़ती है। वहीं, कुछ महिलाओं को मेनोपॉज के दौरान स्किन टोन और टेक्सचर में बड़े बदलाव नजर आते हैं। अगर सही खानपान, स्किन केयर और लाइफस्टाइल में बैलेंस रखा जाए, तो हार्मोनल इम्बैलेंस के कारण होने वाली स्किन प्रॉब्लम्स से राहत पाई जा सकती है। हार्मोनल बदलावों से स्किन सबसे ज्यादा प्रभावित होती है। टेस्टोस्टेरोन बढ़ने से ऑयली स्किन और एक्ने की समस्या होती है, जबकि एस्ट्रोजन लेवल घटने से ड्राइनेस और एजिंग साइन्स दिखते हैं। सही स्किन केयर रूटीन अपनाना बेहद जरूरी है। ऑयली स्किन वालों को सैलिसिलिक एसिड बेस्ड क्लींजर इस्तेमाल करना चाहिए, जबकि ड्राई स्किन के लिए हाइलूरोनिक एसिड और सेरामाइड्स युक्त मॉइश्चराइजर फायदेमंद रहेगा। साथ ही, हार्मोन बैलेंस करने के लिए पर्याप्त नींद, हाइड्रेशन और सही डाइट लेना जरूरी है। हार्मोनल इम्बैलेंस का स्किन पर असर तभी कम होगा जब हम अंदरूनी कारणों को भी समझें। पीसीओएस, थायरॉइड, स्ट्रेस और इंसुलिन रेजिस्टेंस स्किन प्रॉब्लम्स को बढ़ाते हैं। खाने में फाइबर और एंटीऑक्सीडेंट्स से भरपूर फूड्स शामिल करें। अत्यधिक प्रोसेस्ड फूड, कैफीन और शुगर से बचें, क्योंकि ये हार्मोन को और असंतुलित कर सकते हैं।",

            "description": "Naming Tensions: Gulf of Mexico vs. Gulf of America The White House escalated its longstanding tensions with news organizations by demanding the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, a move pushed by President Donald Trump. The Associated Press (AP) refused to comply, citing geographical accuracy and precedent.As a response, AP journalists found themselves barred from White House events, a retaliatory act described by many media advocates as an affront to press freedom enshrined in the First Amendment. Despite the White House's insistence that the new designation is factual, the AP and other major outlets remain committed to using 'Gulf of Mexico.'International media groups and freedom of speech advocates have condemned the White House's actions as censorious and intimidating. This situation underscores the ever-present tension between governmental authority and independent journalism in shaping public discourse.",
