            "description": "Lucknow Super Giants head coach Justin Langer received a reporter's mother’s call during the press conference after his side’s 12-run win over Mumbai Indians at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow on Friday, April 4. Lucknow Super Giants registered their second win of the season and first win at home against Mumbai Indians. After posting a total of 203/8 in 20 overs, thanks to fifties by Mitchell Marsh (60) and Aiden Markram (53), LSG bowlers restricted MI to 191/5 overs despite a half-century by Suryakumar Yadav (67 off 43 balls). Shardul Thakur, Avesh Khan, Akash Deep, and Digvesh Singh Rathi played crucial roles in the LSG’s victory. In the last three overs of the Mumbai Indians’ 204-run chase, Avesh, Digvesh, and Shardul held their nerves as they combined conceded just 27 runs when the visitors required 40 runs off 18 balls to win the match. Justin Langer was a happy man as the Lucknow Super Giants managed to pull off a thrilling victory in front of their home crowd after losing their previous match against Punjab Kings.

However, during the press meet, the LSG coach happened to receive a phone call from the reporter's mother. The reporter kept his mobile phone on the table to record Justin Langer’s press conference. The former Australia batter and head coach hilariously picked up the reporter’s call. “Who is Ma? Who's Mum's ringing? Do you want me to answer? Hello. Mama, it's 12:08. I'm at a press conference.\" Langer said.

The Rishabh Pant-led side registered their second defeat of the season following an 8-wicket defeat against Punjab Kings. In the match against Mumbai Indians, Lucknow Super Giants turned their tables around as they registered their first home win of the season. With two wins and as many losses, Lucknow Super Giants moved to sixth spot on the points table with four points and has a NRR of -0.048 in four matches. Justin Langer credits NCA for getting Avesh Khan and Akash Deep fit in time LSG head coach Justin Langer lauded the efforts of the staff at National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru for getting their fast bowlers, Avesh Khan and Akash Deep fit in time for the season. “NCA, to their credit, have obviously done a very good job because they've got Avesh Khan back for us, they've got our Akash Deep back for us.” Langer said. “So we really appreciate the work they're doing to get the boys back playing and now hopefully Mayank as well,\" he added. Avesh Khan and Akash Deep missed the first few matches of the Lucknow Super Giants as they were recovering from respective injuries. Mayank Yadav is set to make his return soon and might feature in the second half of the ongoing IPL 2025.

            "description": "हिमाचल सरकार की आज कैबिनेट मीटिंग होने जा रही है। दिल्ली से लौटने के बाद मुख्यमंत्री सुखविंदर सिंह सुक्खू सचिवालय में मीटिंग लेंगे। इसमें बसों का किराया बढ़ाने के अलावा दूसरे महत्वपूर्ण फैसले हो सकते हैं। प्रदेश के प्राइवेट बस ऑपरेटर के साथ एचआरटीसी ने भी बस किराया बढ़ाने का सरकार को प्रस्ताव भेज रखा है। ऐसे में किराया बढ़ौतरी करनी है या नहीं। इस पर कैबिनेट में आज फैसला हो सकता है। हालांकि देश में सबसे ज्यादा बस किराया हिमाचल का ही बताया जा रहा है। स्कूल-कालेज बंद करने पर फैसला कैबिनेट में स्कूल व कालेज बंद करने पर भी फैसला हो सकता है। प्रदेश में 20 से कम स्टूडेंट एनरोलमेंट वाले सेकेंडरी स्कूल और 100 से कम छात्र संख्या वाले कालेजों को बंद किया जा सकता है। सूत्र बताते हैं कि कालेजों के मामले में सरकार छात्रों की संख्या की शर्त को 100 से घटाकर 75 भी कर सकती है। बजट घोषणाओं को मिलेगी मंजूरी कैबिनेट मीटिंग में 2025-26 के बजट भाषण में मुख्यमंत्री द्वारा की गई घोषणाओं को भी मंजूरी के लिए लाया जा सकता है, क्योंकि बजट घोषणाओं को कैबिनेट की मंजूरी अनिवार्य रहती है। करुणामूलक नौकरी को मंजूरी दे सकती है सरकार कैबिनेट में करुणामूलक नौकरी के लंबित मामलों को एकमुश्त भरने की भी मंजूरी मिल सकती है। यह मामला लंबे समय से उठता रहा है। विधानसभा बजट सत्र में भी मृतक कर्मियों के आश्रितों को नौकरी नहीं मिलने का मामला गूंजा था। लिहाजा सरकार आज करुणामूलक कोटे से लगभग 1800 पदों को एकमुश्त भरने की छूट दे सकती है।",

His journey reached its eighth day, with Ambani expressing his spiritual dedication as he prepares to bow before the revered deity, Dwarikadhish.Since commencing this spiritual walk on March 29, Ambani has trekked approximately 20 kilometres per night, preparing to conclude his journey on April 8, coinciding with the eve of his 30th birthday. Alongside his personal spiritual quest, Ambani continues to encounter and inspire acts of reverence and solidarity from fellow travellers and locals along the way.Despite the serious health challenges posed by Cushing's Syndrome, morbid obesity, asthma, and a severe lung condition, Ambani remains undeterred, chanting sacred texts such as the Hanuman Chalisa on his route. Beyond spirituality, he balances responsibilities as a key figure in Reliance Industries, overseeing major projects, and supporting religious causes.",

            "description": "Courtroom Clash: Objectionable Art Sparks Legal Debate Delhi's Patiala House Court witnessed heated exchanges on Friday over a revision petition demanding an FIR against an art gallery for displaying allegedly controversial paintings by renowned artist M F Hussain. The petitioner asserts that those responsible for showcasing the art should be aware of legal implications.Additional Sessions Judge Sumit Dass presides over the case, which challenges a magistrate court's prior dismissal of the FIR request. Proceedings have been scheduled for further arguments on April 21. Complainant Advocate Amita Sachdeva argues that Hussain's work disrespects deities by depicting them in objectionable ways.The gallery's defense maintains that the exhibition, which ran for 30 days, drew no objections apart from Sachdeva's complaint. Despite the magistrate court declining additional investigations, Judge Dass continues to explore whether legal standards of self-censorship apply within art galleries.",

            "description": "Donald Trump Remove NSA: अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप ने फिर से एक ऐसा फैसला लिया है, जिसने न केवल अमेरिका बल्कि वैश्विक राजनीति में हलचल मचा दी है. इस बार उन्होंने राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा एजेंसी (NSA) के डायरेक्टर और चार-स्‍टार जनरल टिमोथी हॉग को बर्खास्त कर दिया है. लॉरा लूमर नामक एक दक्षिणपंथी कार्यकर्ता के अनुरोध के तुरंत बाद यह कार्रवाई हुई, जिसमें उन्होंने ऐसे अधिकारियों को हटाने की मांग की थी जो ट्रंप के एजेंडे के अनुरूप नहीं हैं. यह घटना बताती है कि ट्रंप वफादारी को योग्यता से ऊपर रख रहे हैं, और सत्ता में रहते हुए वह अपने आलोचकों को किसी भी कीमत पर बर्दाश्त नहीं करेंगे.जनरल टिमोथी हॉग को साइबर और खुफिया दुनिया में 33 साल का अनुभव था. वह ट्रंप के आलोचक रहे हैं और संभवतः पूर्व जनरल मार्क मिले के करीबी माने जाते थे. उनकी बर्खास्तगी की कोई औपचारिक वजह नहीं दी गई. बल्कि इसके पीछे लॉरा लूमर जैसे बाहरी लोगों का प्रभाव दिखता है. यह बेहद चिंताजनक है कि अमेरिका की राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा जैसी संवेदनशील संस्थाओं में फैसले राजनीतिक वफादारी के आधार पर लिए जा रहे हैं. इसके अलावा, हॉग की डिप्टी, वेंडी नोबल को भी पद से हटा दिया गया. ट्रंप के करीबी यह मानते हैं कि जो अधिकारी उनकी विचारधारा के प्रति वफादार नहीं हैं, वे अमेरिका की \"महानता\" के रास्ते में रुकावट हैं.लूमर का हस्तक्षेप लॉरा लूमर, जो कि कट्टर दक्षिणपंथी मानी जाती हैं. उनका प्रभाव इस निर्णय में साफ दिखाई देता है. उन्होंने हाल ही में ट्रंप से मुलाकात कर NSA और NSS में मौजूद \"ग़ैर-वफादार\" अधिकारियों को हटाने की मांग की थी.उनका मानना है कि जनरल हॉग पूर्व प्रशासन की विचारधारा के नुमाइंदे हैं और ट्रंप के “Make America Great Again” अभियान में रुकावट हैं. ट्रंप का यह कदम इस बात का संकेत है कि वह अपने कार्यकाल में ऐसे लोगों को स्थान नहीं देंगे जिनपर वह भरोसा नहीं करते, चाहे उनकी योग्यता और अनुभव कितना भी क्यों न हो.राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा पर खतरा या केवल खर्च में कटौती? एक और महत्वपूर्ण एंगल सिग्नल-गेट विवाद से जुड़ा है. यमन में हूती हमलों से संबंधित संवेदनशील जानकारी सिग्नल ऐप पर लीक हुई थी. हालांकि जनरल हॉग का इसमें कोई प्रत्यक्ष संबंध नहीं था, फिर भी इस घटना ने NSA और NSS के अंदर विश्वास का संकट खड़ा कर दिया. इसके अलावा, यह निर्णय DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) के तहत खर्च कम करने के मकसद से सरकारी कर्मचारियों की छंटनी का हिस्सा भी हो सकता है. हालांकि, विशेषज्ञों का मानना है कि यह सिर्फ खर्च की बात नहीं, बल्कि ट्रंप की एक बड़ी राजनीतिक सफाई प्रक्रिया का हिस्सा है, जिसमें वे सिर्फ उन्हीं को प्रशासन में रखना चाहते हैं जो पूरी तरह से उनके प्रति वफादार हों.",

Though his defense has yet to suggest a sentence, prosecutors deem an 87-month term fitting for the severity of his crimes.Santos's fraudulent claims about his education and career and personal enrichment at the expense of donors, resulted in a bipartisan House expulsion. The former representative acknowledged his misconduct, expressing remorse and accountability for his actions.",
