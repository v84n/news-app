            "description": "US President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued an executive order to prevent transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports unless they were assigned female at birth, The New York Times reported. He also vowed to withhold federal funding from high schools and colleges that fail to comply with the directive. \"From now on, women's sports will be only for women,\" Trump said in his address from the White House East Room. \"The war on women's sports is over.\" President Trump signs executive order banning Transgender women from competing in women’s sports 👀 pic.twitter.com/VKk3u82qBj — FearBuck (@FearedBuck) February 5, 2025 The White House in an executive order titled 'Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,' stated that in recent years, many educational institutions and athletic associations have allowed men to compete in women's sports. It further said that \"ignoring fundamental biological truths\" between the two sexes deprives women and girls of \"meaningful access to educational facilities.\" \"This is demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls, and denies women and girls the equal opportunity to participate and excel in competitive sports. Moreover, under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 (Title IX), educational institutions receiving Federal funds cannot deny women an equal opportunity to participate in sports. As some Federal courts have recognised, ignoring fundamental biological truths between the two sexes deprives women and girls of meaningful access to educational facilities,\" the statement read. It added, \"Therefore, it is the policy of the United States to rescind all funds from educational programmes that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities, which results in the endangerment, humiliation, and silencing of women and girls and deprives them of privacy. It shall also be the policy of the United States to oppose male competitive participation in women's sports more broadly, as a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth.\" This new order follows on one Trump signed on January 20, which ordered the federal government to define sex as only male or female and to change federal policies and government-issued IDs to reflect that. Trump, along with other conservative politicians, have often hit on transgender athletes competing in women's sports as an election-cycle issue. And 25 states have passed laws banning transgender athletes from girls' sports at the high school and youth levels, The New York Times reported. A few days back, the White House had issued an executive order prohibiting federal funding, support, or promotion of medical procedures intended to transition a child's sex, citing concerns over their long-term consequences. The order stated that medical professionals are engaging in \"chemical and surgical mutilation\" of children under the \"radical and false claim that adults can change a child's sex through a series of irreversible medical interventions.\" The administration described these procedures as dangerous, and asserted that affected children may suffer from permanent sterilisation and lifelong medical complications, the report added.",

            "description": "Bhubaneswar: The Odisha government has announced an ex-gratia of Rs 4 lakh each to the family members of the two minor students who drowned in the Kuakhai River here on Wednesday, officials said. Odisha Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi on Wednesday expressed grief over the death of the students in Kuakhai. \"CM Mohan Charan Majhi has expressed deep sorrow over the tragic drowning of two students during Saraswati idol immersion in Kuakhai River, near Rangabazar, under Balianta block. He extended condolences to the bereaved families. The state government has announced Rs 4 lakh ex-gratia assistance for each family from the State Disaster Response Fund,\" said the Chief Minister's Office on X. The deceased were identified as Dibyajyoti Mahalik and Sikun Senapati from Unit-6 area under police limits in Bhubaneswar. Both the students were 15 years old and studied in class 10. Sources claimed that the deceased minors along with their teacher and other friends had gone to the Rangabazar area for the immersion of the Saraswati idol. The two students went into the river water carrying the Goddess idol while the others were at the river bank. Dibyajyoti and Sikun, who entered the river to immerse the idol, lost control and fell into the deep waters. The students failed to come out of the water despite all their efforts. Finding no option, the tuition teacher called up the police and the Fire Service personnel for help. The minors were later fished out of the river by fire services personnel who rushed them to Capital Hospital where the doctors declared the duo dead. The Balianta Police have launched an investigation into the incident by registering an unnatural death case.(IANS)",

मैं बांग्लादेश के लोगों से इंसाफ चाहती हूं। क्या मैंने अपने देश के लिए कुछ नहीं किया? फिर इतना अपमान क्यों? एक इमारत को मिटाया जा सकता है, लेकिन इतिहास को नहीं मिटाया जा सकता। मेरे पिता का घर तोड़ने वालों को याद रखना चाहिए कि इतिहास अपना बदला लेता है। शेख मुजीब के आवास और संग्रहालय में भी घुसे उपद्रवीबांग्लादेश में हाल ही में हिंसा की शुरुआत सोशल मीडिया पर ‘बुलडोजर जुलूस’ के ऐलान के बाद हुई। जब हमला हुआ, तब वहां सुरक्षाबल भी मौजूद थे। भीड़ को वहां से जाने के लिए समझाने की कोशिश की, लेकिन सारी कोशिशें नाकाम रहीं। कुछ उपद्रवी शेख मुजीब के आवास और संग्रहालय में भी घुस गए। बालकनी पर चढ़ गए और तोड़फोड़ की। बताया जा रहा है कि आवास में आगजनी भी की गई है। इसके कई वीडियो और तस्वीरें सोशल मीडिया पर वायरल हो रहे हैं। कल हिंसा क्यों भड़की?दरअसल, शेख हसीना की पार्टी अवामी लीग ने 6 फरवरी को अपने कार्यकर्ताओं और नेताओं को सड़क पर उतरने की अपील की थी। पार्टी पूर्व PM हसीना पर लगे कथित मामले दर्ज करने और अल्पसंख्यकों पर हमले के विरोध में मार्च निकालने का आह्वान किया था। कल शेख हसीना के बांग्लादेश छोड़ने के 6 महीने पूरे हो गए हैं। रात 9 बजे शेख हसीना अपने समर्थकों के लिए ऑनलाइन भाषण देने वाली थीं। इससे पहले '24 रिवोल्यूशनरी स्टूडेंट-जनता' नाम के छात्र संगठन ने इसके विरोध में रात 9 बजे ‘बुलडोजर मार्च’ निकालने का ऐलान किया। इसके लिए सोशल मीडिया पर प्रचार किया गया। इसमें शेख हसीना के पिता का घर गिराए जाने की बात कही गई, लेकिन प्रदर्शनकारी 8 बजे ही शेख मुजीबुर्ररहमान के घर धनमंडी-32 पहुंच गए और तोड़फोड़ शुरू कर दी। हिंसा और तोड़फोड़ की 10 फुटेज... प्रदर्शनकारी 'शेख हसीना को फांसी दो' के नारे लगा रहे थे प्रदर्शनकारी शेख मुजीबुर्ररहमान के घर का मेनगेट तोड़कर अंदर घुस गए। इस दौरान वे 'फांसी दो, फांसी दो। शेख हसीना को फांसी दो।' पूरे बंगाल (बांग्लादेश) को खबर दो, मुजीबुर्रहमान की कब्र खोद दो' 'अवामी लीग के लोगों को पीटो, बांग्लादेश में वे नहीं रहेंगे' के नारे लगा रहे थे। प्रदर्शनकारियों का कहना था कि मुजीबुर्रहमान का घर ‘फासीवादियों का गढ़’ है, इससे छुटकारा पाना जरूरी है।' इसी घर में हुई थी बंगबंधु की हत्या बांग्लादेश के संस्थापक शेख मुजीबुर्रहमान इसी घर में रहा करते थे। 15 अगस्त 1975 को बंगबंधु, उनकी पत्नी, बेटे, बहू और कई रिश्तेदारों की इसी घर में हत्या कर दी गई थी। इसके बाद इस घर को एक स्मारक संग्रहालय के रूप में बनाया गया था। इससे पहले 5 अगस्त 2024 को शेख हसीना के देश छोड़ने के बाद भीड़ ने इस घर पर हमला किया था। तोड़फोड़ कर आग लगा दी गई थी। तब से यह घर वीरान था। आरक्षण के खिलाफ आंदोलन ने किया था तख्तापलटशेख हसीना पिछले साल 5 अगस्त को देश छोड़कर भारत आ गई थीं। दरअसल, उनके खिलाफ देशभर में छात्र प्रदर्शन कर रहे थे। बांग्लादेश में 5 जून को हाईकोर्ट ने जॉब में 30% कोटा सिस्टम लागू किया था, इस आरक्षण के खिलाफ ढाका में यूनिवर्सिटीज के स्टूडेंट्स प्रोटेस्ट कर रहे थे। यह आरक्षण स्वतंत्रता सेनानियों के परिवारों को दिया जा रहा था। हसीना की सरकार ने जैसे ही यह आरक्षण खत्म किया तो इसके बाद छात्रों ने उनके इस्तीफे की मांग शुरू कर दी। देखते ही देखते बड़ी संख्या में छात्र और आम लोग हसीना और उनकी सरकार के खिलाफ सड़क पर उतर आए। इस प्रोटेस्ट के दो महीने बाद 5 अगस्त को उन्होंने प्रधानमंत्री पद से इस्तीफा दे दिया था। इसके बाद अंतरिम सरकार की स्थापना की गई। हसीना का पासपोर्ट रद्द, गिरफ्तारी वारंट जारीबांग्लादेश में तख्तापलट के बाद बनी यूनुस सरकार ने हसीना पर हत्या, अपहरण से लेकर देशद्रोह के 225 से ज्यादा मामले दर्ज किए हैं। वहीं, बांग्लादेशी सरकार ने चेतावनी दी है कि भारत में रहते हुए हसीना की तरफ से दिए जा रहे बयान दोनों देशों के संबंध बिगाड़ रहे हैं।​​​​ बांग्लादेश सरकार ने जुलाई में हुई हत्याओं की वजह से शेख हसीना का पासपोर्ट भी रद्द कर दिया है। वहीं बांग्लादेश के इंटरनेशनल क्रिमिनल ट्रिब्यूनल ने उनके खिलाफ गिरफ्तारी वारंट जारी किया था। ट्रिब्यूनल ने हसीना को 12 फरवरी तक पेश होने का निर्देश दिया है। बांग्लादेश भारत से हसीना को डिपोर्ट करने की अपील भी कर चुका है। हालांकि, भारत सरकार उनका वीजा बढ़ा चुकी है, जिससे यह साफ हो गया कि उन्हें बांग्लादेश डिपोर्ट नहीं किया जाएगा। .................................................. शेख हसीना से जुड़ी ये खबरें भी पढ़ें... हसीना बोलीं- मौत मुझसे सिर्फ 20-25 मिनट दूर थी:विरोधियों ने मुझे मारने की साजिश रची, लेकिन अल्लाह ने मुझे बचाया बांग्लादेश की पूर्व प्रधानमंत्री शेख हसीना ने अपने राजनीतिक विरोधियों पर उन्हें मारने की साजिश का आरोप लगाया। हसीना की पार्टी अवामी लीग ने उनका ऑडियो क्लिप जारी किया है। इसमें हसीना ने बताया कि कैसे वे और उनकी बहन पिछले साल अगस्त में जान बचाकर देश से भागीं थी। पूरी खबर यहां पढ़ें... बांग्लादेश में 6 फरवरी से विरोध प्रदर्शन करेगी अवामी लीग:हसीना पर दर्ज आपराधिक मामलों को हटाने की मांग की बांग्लादेश में पूर्व प्रधानमंत्री शेख हसीना की पार्टी अवामी लीग ने देश भर में विरोध प्रदर्शन, हड़ताल और नाकेबंदी का ऐलान किया है। अवामी लीग ने शेख हसीना के खिलाफ दर्ज मुकदमों और देश में धार्मिक अल्पसंख्यकों पर हो रहे उत्पीड़न के विरोध में ये घोषणा की है। पूरी खबर यहां पढ़ें...",

            "description": "कुंभ नगरी में 13 अखाड़ों के शिविर सेक्टर 12 में हैं। किन्नर अखाड़े का कैंप यहां से बहुत दूर सेक्टर 16 में हैं। यहां मुझे एक किन्नर महंत अपने साथी से फर्राटेदार अंग्रेजी में बात करती दिखीं। पूछने पर किसी ने बताया ये जयंती हैं। चमचमाती बनारसी साड़ी, गले पर तर-ऊपर लदे गहने। माथे पर रोली की बड़ी सी लाल बिंदी। सांवला रंग उस पर मेकअप एकदम टिपटॉप। मैंने जयंती से पूछ लिया कि आप किन्नर महंत कैसे बनीं? कहती हैं कि लोग हमारे साथ नॉर्मल बिहेव नहीं करते। उन्हें हमारे टैलेंट में कोई इंटरेस्ट नहीं। हम सोसाइटी को क्या दे सकते हैं, ये कोई नहीं देखता। बस ये सोचते हैं कि किन्नर सिर्फ दो काम कर सकता है या तो ताली बजाकर भीख मांगेगा या देह बेचेगा। चेहरे पर गुस्से के भाव के साथ इंग्लिश में वो कहती हैं... ‘डोन्ट ट्राई टू चेक आवर बेडरूम स्टोरीज, ट्राई टू सी हाउ प्रोडक्टिव वी केन बी फॉर द सोसाइटी।’ ब्लैकबोर्ड में आज पढ़े-लिखे और जॉब करने वाले ऐसे किन्नरों की कहानी जिन्होंने सामाजिक बैरियर तो तोड़ा, फिर भी समाज उन्हें अपना नहीं पाया... जयंती कहती हैं, कोविड का दौर कोई भूल नहीं सकता, लेकिन मेरे लिए तो ये और भी डरावना था। अक्टूबर 2020 की बात है, लॉकडाउन का दौर था और शारदीय नवरात्र भी चल रहे थे। खाने-पीने का जरूरी सामान लेने घर से निकली थी। रास्ते में चार लोगों ने मुझे किडनैप कर लिया। चारो नशे में थे और उनमें से तीन ने मेरा रेप किया। उनके साथ जो चौथा आदमी था वो बार-बार कह रहा था कि मुझे तो लड़की चाहिए। उन्होंने चाकू मार कर रेप किया और मरने के लिए छोड़ दिया। जयंती कहती हैं किसी भले व्यक्ति ने मुझे हॉस्पिटल पहुंचा दिया। मैं बच गई, लेकिन तभी सर्जरी भी करवा ली और लड़की बन गई। करियर सेट होने के बाद पर्सनल लाइफ भी सेटल हो गई। सक्षम थी तो ये सब कर पाई। हर किन्नर को सक्षम बनना चाहिए। हम जैसे स्पेशल चाइल्ड को घर से बाहर न फेंके, वो सोसाइटी में अनसेफ हैं। जयंती ठाकुर किन्नर अखाड़े की महंत हैं। महामंडलेश्वर डॉ. लक्ष्मी नारायण त्रिपाठी उनकी गुरु हैं। जयंती हैं तो साउथ इंडियन, लेकिन दिल्ली में रहती हैं। यहीं एक मल्टीनेशनल कंपनी में मैनेजर हैं। जयंती कहती हैं किन्नर बच्चा हो, जवान हो या फिर बूढ़ा। उसके जन्म लेते ही परेशानियां शुरू हो जाती हैं। पहले परिवार और फिर समाज। मैं भी इन सब से आज तक जूझ रही हूं। स्कूल-कॉलेज में लोग गुड़, मीठा, मामू, मीठा-चावल, छक्का कहकर बुलाते थे। अच्छी बात ये थी कि मेरे मां-बाप साथ थे। उन्होंने मुझे संभालकर रखा और जहां तक उनसे बन पाया पढ़ाया। पढ़ाई पूरी होने के बाद जॉब लग गई। शुरुआत में घर में ही रही, लेकिन सामाजिक प्रेशर इतना ज्यादा था कि मां-बाप ने मुझे बेहतर जिंदगी के लिए घर से दूर जाकर नौकरी करने की सलाह दी। दिल्ली आ गई। यहां धक्के खाने के बाद एक ऐसी कंपनी में नौकरी मिली जहां एलजीबीटी को सम्मान दिया जाता है। 13 साल से इस कंपनी में जॉब कर रही हूं। वैसे अब मैनेजर हूं तो कम से कम लोग मेरे मुंह पर तो कुछ उल्टा-पुल्टा नहीं कहते, लेकिन पीठ पीछे बातें करते हैं। लोगों को लगता हैं कि ये पोस्ट मैं डिजर्व नहीं करती। मेरी तरक्की से जलते हैं। शुरुआत में मुझे भी दिक्कत हुई, लेकिन कंपनी पॉलिसी के कारण लोग खुल कर कुछ कह नहीं पाते। लोग हैरान रह जाते हैं कि आखिर कैसे इसे इतनी अच्छी नौकरी मिल गई। ऑफिस के बाहर की दुनिया तो कुछ समझती ही नहीं, उनके लिए हिजड़ा ही हूं। हमें अश्लील नजरों से देखते हैं। 9 साल की थी तब सबसे पहले मामा ने, फिर जिस दुकान में काम करती थी वहां भी शारीरिक शोषण हुआ। डरती थी, कभी मां-बाप को अपनी परेशानी नहीं बता पाई। मेरे पापा सिक्योरिटी गार्ड थे। हम स्कूल तो जाते थे, लेकिन यूनिफॉर्म, जूते के लिए तरसते थे। 10वीं के बाद आगे की पढ़ाई के पैसे नहीं थे। इसलिए एक कपड़े की दुकान में साफ सफाई का काम करने लगी। यहां से 600 रुपए मिल जाते थे। मुझे लगा कि ऐसे तो जिंदगी नहीं चल पाएगी। आगे बढ़ने के लिए और समाज से लड़ने के लिए और पढ़ना पड़ेगा। साफ सफाई का काम छोड़कर 3 साल के गैप के बाद फिर से पढ़ाई शुरू की। बच्चों को ट्यूशन भी पढ़ाने लगी। ग्रेजुएशन के साथ-साथ एक स्कूल में इंग्लिश भी पढ़ा रही थी। साल 2008 में कॉल सेंटर का बूम आया। मैंने भी इंटरव्यू देना शुरू कर दिया, लेकिन नौकरी नहीं मिली। फिर मैंने पढ़ाई पूरी की और दो-तीन नौकरियां भी बदलीं। आज यूके की सबसे बड़ी बैंकिंग कंपनी में मैनेजर के रोल पर काम कर रही हूं। जयंती कहती हैं कि अब समय बदल रहा है इसलिए समाज को भी सोच बदलने की जरूरत है। बेटा- बेटी ही नहीं, एक किन्नर भी घर चला सकता है। एक किन्नर भी किसी के घर की बहू बन सकती है, अपने मां बाप को पाल सकती है। किन्नरों को भी एक मौका दीजिए, क्या पता कल आपका स्पेशल चाइल्ड लक्ष्मी नारायण त्रिपाठी, गौरी सावंत, सुशांत दिग्वीकर या फिर जयंती ठाकुर जैसा बन जाए। इतना कहते-कहते जयंती की आंखों से भरभराकर आंसू गालों तक बह निकले... पल भर चुप रहने के बाद वे ऊपर देखते हुए कहती हैं, जब लॉकडाउन में चार लोगों ने मेरा रेप किया तो समझ आया कि जो वहशी होते हैं, उन्हें बस हवस बुझानी होती है फिर चाहे कोई किन्नर हो, बच्चा हो या कोई लड़की हो। हम भी दूसरे बच्चों की तरह एक मां की कोख से 9 महीने बाद ही जन्म लेते हैं। किन्नर अखाड़े में मां पवित्रा नंद गिरी से आशीर्वाद लेने लोग लाइन लगाए खड़े हैं। सबसे फ्री होकर मुझसे मिली। कहती हैं कि किन्नरों के साथ हमेशा भेदभाव होता है। काम नहीं मिलता, रहने के लिए कोई घर नहीं देता। हमें देखकर लोग किराया बढ़ा देते हैं। हम जैसे अधिकतर लोग झुग्गियों में रहते हैं। हमारे लिए पढ़ाई-लिखाई बहुत जरूरी है। पढ़ेंगे तो नौकरी मिलेगी। कम से कम अपना शरीर नहीं बेचना पड़ेगा। ऐसा नहीं है कि नौकरी मिलने के बाद परेशानियां कम हो जाती हैं। ऑफिस में हमारे साथ क्या व्यवहार होता है ये सिर्फ हम जानते हैं। बिना किसी से नजर मिलाए अपना काम करना होता है। किसी से नजर मिल ही गई, तो वो न जाने क्या समझ लेता है। मैंने बीएससी नर्सिंग करके 15 साल नौकरी की। जब लोगों को पता चला कि किन्नर हूं तो उनका नजरिया ही बदल गया। हम बस हंसी-ठिठोली का पात्र बनकर रह जाते हैं। मेरी एजुकेशन, मेरा एक्सपीरियंस कुछ भी मायने नहीं रखता, बस हमें ताली बजाने वाला छक्का समझा जाता है। हमें सिग्नल पर खड़े होकर भीख नहीं मांगना या जिस्म बेचकर पैसे नहीं कमाने इसलिए अपमान सहकर भी हम नौकरी करते हैं। मैं जब जॉब करती थी तो भी लोग मुझे चिढ़ाते थे। कहते थे ये तो छक्का है, क्या काम करेगा, इन्हें तो गलियों में जाना चाहिए, यहां क्या कर रही हैं। मुझे काम करता देख कलीग जलते थे। उन्हें हजम नहीं होता कि उनसे बेहतर कैसे कर रहे हैं। हमें तो प्रमोशन भी नहीं मिलता। मैं मानती हूं कि मेहनत करके ही पैसा कमाना चाहिए क्योंकि मेहनत का पैसा जिंदगी भर फल देता है। हम लोगों से अपील करते हैं कि एजुकेशन लें और समाज भी उन्हें अपनाए। हमारे अखाड़े का निर्माण भी इसलिए ही हुआ है ताकि किन्नरों को सही रास्ता दिखाया जा सके। अगर मैं कंधे से कंधा मिलाकर समाज के लिए काम कर रही हूं तो समाज भी हमें सम्मान और बराबरी का मौका देता है। अगर 10 में से 2 लोग हमें अच्छा समझते हैं तो इसके पीछे सबसे बड़ा कारण एजुकेशन है। महामंडलेश्वर इंदुनंद गिरी तंबू के अंदर हाथ में एक त्रिशूल लेकर बैठी हैं। माथे पर चंदन का टीका, बड़ी सी बिंदी, गले में रुद्राक्ष की माला, सोने की चेन, हाथ में चूड़ियां और कंगन पहने ध्यान की मुद्रा में हैं। ध्यान से उठने के बाद हमारे बीच बातचीत शुरू होती है। महाकुंभ की तारीफ और महादेव का नाम लेने के साथ वो बात की शुरुआत करती हैं। वो कहती हैं कि बचपन से मुझे मां काली की भक्ति बहुत पसंद है। मुझे मां का हर रूप पसंद है, लेकिन काली रूप सबसे ज्यादा। बचपन की यादें सांझा करते हुए वे कहती हैं कि लोगों की बातें और कटाक्ष असहनीय होते थे। खुल के बात भी नहीं कर पाती थी। मेकअप, डांस करना और पेंटिंग करना पसंद था, लेकिन सब छुपकर करती थी। स्कूल जाती थी तो लोग अजीब नजरों से देखते थे। घर से निकलने में भी डर लगता था। लगता था कि सबसे अलग हूं और मेरे जैसा कोई नहीं है। बड़े होने पर किन्नर कम्युनिटी का पता चला। वहां से मुझे सपोर्ट मिला, जिसकी वजह से यहां तक पहुंची। मेकअप आर्टिस्ट थी तो काम मिलने में दिक्कत नहीं हुई। जब लोगों को पता चला कि किन्नर हूं, तो परेशानी शुरू हो गई। सब कहने लगे, माहौल खराब हो जाएगा। किन्नर लोग चोर होते हैंं, गलत काम करते हैं, इनके कारण कोई भी ग्राहक नहीं आएगा। इसलिए मुझे वहां से निकाल दिया गया। मेकअप करना, किसी को सजाना-संवारना मेरे लिए जुनून जैसा था। सारे अपमान को भूल कर मैंने काम किया। धीरे-धीरे लोग मुझे पसंद करने लगे। समाज हमारे जेंडर को टारगेट करता है, हमारे हुनर पर नजर नहीं डालता। हम भी इज्जत से कमाना, रहना और खाना चाहते हैं। किन्नर अखाड़े में मेरी मुलाकात ईशा बेंजमिन से हुई। वो एक फोल्डिंग पर बैठी हैं। उनके पीछे मां दुर्गा की प्रतिमा रखी है और आसपास से भक्तों का आना-जाना लगा है। ईशा बताती हैं कि उनका जन्म मुंबई में हुआ, लेकिन अब दिल्ली में रहती हैं। पापा यहूदी थे और मां सनातनी। ईशा कहती हैं, मैं आचार्य महामंडलेश्वर लक्ष्मी नारायण त्रिपाठी की शिष्य हूं। जन्म से तो हम खुद को दुनिया का हिस्सा समझते हैं, लेकिन जब बड़े होते हैं तो ये बता दिया जाता है कि हम अलग हैं। लोगों के देखने का नजरिया, बात करने का तरीका, उनकी सोच ये बताती है कि हम अलग या हटकर हैं। ग्रेजुएट हूं, होटल मैनेजमेंट की डिग्री भी है। यहूदी और सनातन दोनों धर्म समझती थी और दोनों में मेरी आस्था थी। धीरे-धीरे मुझे सनातन अच्छा लगने लगा। गुरु जी ने मुझे सनातन के बारे में बताया और हर दिन कुछ नया सीख रही हूं। यूएस बेस्ड कंपनी में जॉब करती हूं और मेरा वर्क फ्रॉम होम है। हमारी कंपनी एलजीबीटी कम्युनिटी को बहुत सपोर्ट करती है। इसके बावजूद हम लोगों को नहीं बदल सकते। जैसे लोग चावल से कंकड़ चुनकर फेंक देते हैं, ठीक वैसे ही मैं लोगों की बातें नजरअंदाज करती हूं। मुझे ट्रैवल में ज्यादा दिक्कत होती थी। कोई गलत तरीके से छूने का बहाना खोजता था, तो कोई मजाक बनाता था। लोग वॉशरूम के बाहर खड़े होकर देखते कि औरतों वाले में जाएगी या मर्दों वाले में। हायर एजुकेशन के दौरान मुझे बहुत शोषण झेलना पड़ा था। लोग गंदे-गंदे कमेंट करते, लेटर लिख कर देते और घर तक फॉलो करते थे। मैं एजुकेटेड हूं तो लोग मुझे अलग नजरिए से देखते हैं, सम्मान देते हैं। मैं इंटरनेट पर एजुकेटेड किन्नर के नाम से वायरल हूं। आज से 10 साल पहले हम जैसे लोगों के लिए एजुकेशन की दिक्कत थी, लेकिन अब समय बदल चुका है। मैं लोगों से अपील करना चाहती हूं कि बच्चा, किन्नर हो तो उसे घर से मत निकालो। कई बच्चे शर्म के मारे खुद ही घर छोड़ के चले जाते हैं। इसको बदलने की जरूरत है और ये सिर्फ एजुकेशन से ही होगा। एजुकेशन के कारण मुझे ना तो भीख मांगनी पड़ती है और ना ही देह बेचनी पड़ती है। मुझसे मिलने और आशीर्वाद लेने लोग दूर-दूर से आते हैं।

            "description": "5 फरवरी की दोपहर करीब 2 बजे। अमृतसर के श्री गुरु रामदासजी इंटरनेशनल एयरपोर्ट पर अमेरिका का C-17 ग्लोबमास्टर प्लेन लैंड किया। इसमें से 104 अवैध भारतीय अप्रवासी उतरे, जिन्हें ट्रम्प सरकार ने कैदियों की तरह जबरन डिपोर्ट किया है। अवैध अप्रवासियों को मिलिट्री प्लेन से भेजना नॉर्मल फ्लाइट से करीब 6 गुना महंगा है, फिर भी इसका इस्तेमाल करके ट्रम्प ने क्या संदेश दिया और क्या ये भारत सरकार का डिप्लोमैटिक फेल्योर है; जानेंगे आज के एक्सप्लेनर में... सवाल-1: अवैध भारतीय अप्रवासियों को किस दशा में अमेरिका से डिपोर्ट किया गया?जवाब: 20 जनवरी 2025 को अमेरिका के राष्ट्रपति पद की शपथ लेने के बाद अवैध अप्रवासियों के मुद्दे पर ट्रम्प ने कहा, 'हम बुरे, खूंखार अपराधियों को बाहर निकाल रहे हैं। ये हत्यारे हैं। ये सबसे बुरे हैं, जितने आप सोच नहीं सकते। हम सबसे पहले उन्हें बाहर निकाल रहे हैं।' ट्रम्प ने ‘लैकेन रिले एक्ट’ पर साइन किया, जिससे अमेरिकी अधिकारियों को उन अवैध अप्रवासियों को हिरासत में लेकर डिपोर्ट करने का अधिकार मिला, जो किसी आपराधिक गतिविधियों में शामिल रहे हैं। इसके बाद 15 लाख अवैध अप्रवासियों की लिस्ट तैयार की गई, जिसमें 20,407 हजार भारतीय भी हैं। 24 जनवरी को व्हाइट हाउस की प्रेस सचिव कैरोलिन लेविट ने सोशल मीडिया प्लेटफॉर्म X पर हथकड़ी लगे प्रवासियों की तस्वीरें पोस्ट की थीं। जो एक-दूसरे से बंधे हुए थे और एक सैन्य विमान की ओर बढ़ रहे थे। 30 जनवरी 2025 को अमेरिका ने 80 अप्रवासियों को टेक्सास से ग्वाटेमाला भेजा था। इन अप्रवासियों की तस्वीरें भी जारी हुई थीं, जिसमें उनके हाथों में हथकड़ी और पैरों में बेड़ियां बंधी हुई थीं। ट्रम्प प्रशासन ने भारत के अवैध अप्रवासियों की पहली खेप भी मिलिट्री विमान से भेजी। उनकी कोई फोटो या वीडियो मौजूद नहीं है, जिससे ये कन्फर्म नहीं कि भारतीयों को हथकड़ी-बेड़ी पहनाई गई थी या नहीं। हालांकि अभी तक सरकार ने इसका खंडन भी नहीं किया गया है। कांग्रेस नेता पवन खेड़ा ने सोशल मीडिया प्लेटफॉर्म X पर एक पोस्ट में कहा, अमेरिका से डिपोर्ट हुए भारतीयों को हथकड़ी लगाए जाने और अपमानित किए जाने की तस्वीरें देखकर मुझे दुख होता है। सवाल-2: आखिर ट्रम्प अमेरिका में मौजूद अवैध अप्रवासियों पर इतने सख्त क्यों हैं?जवाब: डोनाल्ड ट्रम्प ने चुनाव में अवैध अप्रवासियों को देश से निकालने का वादा करते हुए अमेरिका के इतिहास का सबसे बड़ा डिपोर्टेशन करने को कहा था। ट्रम्प का मानना है कि दूसरे देशों से लोग अमेरिका में अवैध तरीके से घुसकर अपराध करते हैं। यहां नौकरियों के बड़े हिस्से पर अप्रवासियों का कब्जा है, इससे अमेरिकी लोगों को नौकरी नहीं मिलती। कांग्रेस नेता शशि थरूर के मुताबिक अमेरिका से अवैध अप्रवासियों को डिपोर्ट करना कोई अनोखी बात नहीं है। बाइडेन प्रशासन ने भी 1 साल में 1100 अप्रवासियों को भारत वापस भेजा था। अमेरिकी होमलैंड सुरक्षा विभाग की एक रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, 1 अक्टूबर 2023 से 30 सितंबर 2024 तक बाइडेन सरकार ने 1,100 भारतीय अप्रवासियों को भारत वापस भेजने के लिए चार्टर्ड प्लेन और कॉमर्शियल फ्लाइट का इस्तेमाल किया था। इनमें सिर्फ पुरुष और महिलाएं थीं। अवैध अप्रवासियों के बच्चे शामिल नहीं थे। सवाल-3: अवैध प्रवासियों को सामान्य फ्लाइट से भेजा जा सकता था, फिर ट्रम्प ने 6 गुना महंगे मिलिट्री प्लेन से कैदियों की तरह क्यों भेजा?जवाब: ट्रम्प ने अक्सर अवैध अप्रवासियों को ‘एलियन’ और ‘अपराधी’ कहा है, जिन्होंने अमेरिका पर हमला किया। सैन्य विमान से अप्रवासियों को भेजने का उद्देश्य इस ओर इशारा करता है कि ट्रम्प ऐसे अपराधों के प्रति सख्त हैं। ट्रम्प ने कहा, हम अवैध विदेशियों का पता लगा रहे हैं और उन्हें सैन्य विमानों में भरकर वापस उन जगहों पर भेजा जा रहा है जहां से वे आए थे। 24 जनवरी को व्हाइट हाउस की प्रेस सचिव कैरोलिन लेविट ने लिखा, ‘राष्ट्रपति ट्रम्प पूरी दुनिया को एक मजबूत और स्पष्ट संदेश दे रहे हैं कि अगर आप अवैध रूप से अमेरिका में प्रवेश करते हैं, तो आपको गंभीर परिणाम भुगतने होंगे।’ फॉरेन एक्सपर्ट ए.के. पाशा के मुताबिक जिस तरह ट्रम्प ने अवैध अप्रवासियों को कैदियों की तरह भारत वापस भेजा, इससे साफ जाहिर हो रहा है कि वे भारत को एक कमजोर देश समझते हैं। अपने आक्रामक रुख से वो भारत को दबाव में लाना चाहते हैं। सवाल-4: क्या भारतीयों के प्रति ट्रम्प का ये रवैया भारत का डिप्लोमैटिक फेल्योर है?जवाब: 21 जनवरी को वॉशिंगटन डीसी में भारत के विदेश मंत्री एस जयशंकर और अमेरिकी विदेश मंत्री मार्को रुबियो की मुलाकात हुई थी। तब मार्को ने अवैध भारतीय प्रवासियों का मुद्दा उठाया था। इस पर विदेश मंत्री जयशंकर ने कहा था कि भारत उन प्रवासियों को वापस लेने को तैयार हैं, जो अधूरे या बगैर दस्तावेज के अमेरिका पहुंचे थे। एस. जयशंकर ने कहा, 'भारत जांच कर रहा है कि अमेरिका में कितने भारतीय अवैध रूप से रह रहे हैं और इन्हें वापस भेजा जा सकता है या नहीं।' ए.के. पाशा के मुताबिक, ‘पहले भी अवैध अप्रवासी डिपोर्ट किए गए हैं, लेकिन उन्हें इस तरह स्वीकार करना सरकार का डिप्लोमैटिक फेल्योर है। विदेश मंत्री को यह सुनिश्चित करना जरूरी था कि अमेरिका अवैध अप्रवासियों को किस तरह भेजेगा। अगर यह पहले तय हो गया होता तो आज भारत के लोगों के हाथों में हथकड़ियां नहीं होतीं और उन्हें सैन्य विमान से बड़े अपराधियों की तरह डिपोर्ट नहीं किया जाता।’ ट्रम्प ने जब कोलंबिया के अवैध प्रवासियों को अमेरिकी सेना के विमान से उनके देश वापस भेजने की घोषणा की तो कोलंबिया के राष्ट्रपति गुस्तावो पेड्रो ने इसका विरोध किया। उन्होंने कहा कि वो अपने नागरिकों की 'गरिमा' को बनाए रखना चाहते हैं। इसके बाद कोलंबिया वायु सेना के दो विमान अमेरिका गए और वो अवैध प्रवासियों को लेकर राजधानी बोगोटा पहुंचे। सवाल-5: अमेरिका के इस रवैये पर भारत सरकार का क्या रुख है?जवाब: विदेश मामलों के जानकार और JNU के प्रोफेसर राजन कुमार कहते हैं, भारत ट्रम्प के इस रवैये पर खामोश है, क्योंकि PM मोदी और ट्रम्प की मुलाकात होने वाली है। भारत अभी कोई बयान देकर नया विवाद खड़ा नहीं करना चाहता। अगर भारत के किसी बयान से ट्रम्प नाराज हो गए तो यह मुलाकात रद्द हो सकती है।’ ए.के. पाशा ने कहा, PM मोदी फिलहाल ट्रम्प प्रशासन के खिलाफ नहीं बोलेंगे, क्योंकि वे ट्रम्प के साथ दोस्ती को मजबूत करना चाहते हैं। दुनिया के सबसे ताकतवर देश अमेरिका से भारत दुश्मनी करने की स्थिति में नहीं है। सवाल-6: क्या पीएम मोदी और ट्रम्प की मुलाकात से यह मामला सुलझेगा?जवाब: BHU में यूनेस्को चेयर फॉर पीस के प्रोफेसर प्रियंकर उपाध्याय का कहना है कि PM मोदी और अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति ट्रम्प की मुलाकात से अप्रवासियों का डिपोर्टेशन नहीं रुकेगा। भारत इस स्थिति में नहीं है कि अप्रवासियों की वापसी पर रोक लगा सके। अमेरिका सुपर पावर है और बीते कुछ दिनों से अमेरिका और भारत के रिश्तों में दरार पड़ने लगी है। ऐसे में PM मोदी अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति के फैसले को चुनौती नहीं देंगे। 28 जनवरी को PM मोदी ने डोनाल्ड ट्रम्प से फोन पर बात की थी। इसके बाद ट्रम्प ने कहा, अवैध अप्रवासियों के मुद्दे पर मोदी वही करेंगे, जो सही होगा। जब हम अमेरिका में अवैध तरीके से रह रहे भारतीयों को उनके देश भेजेंगे, तो मोदी सही फैसला लेंगे। भारत के साथ हमारे बहुत अच्छे संबंध हैं। हम भारत से IT प्रोफेशनल्स को लेने के लिए तैयार हैं। प्रियंकर उपाध्याय कहते हैं कि भारत का अपने पड़ोसी देशों की तुलना में अमेरिका के साथ दोहरा रवैया है। बांग्लादेश के अप्रवासियों को लेकर सरकार का नजरिया सख्त रहा है, लेकिन अमेरिकी अप्रवासियों के लिए मोदी सरकार ने हामी भर दी, क्योंकि यह इकोनॉमिक माइग्रेंट्स हैं। आसान भाषा में समझें तो यह वो लोग हैं जो अमेरिका में पैसा कमाने के लिए गए थे। इसलिए PM मोदी, ट्रम्प से इस विषय में बात नहीं करेंगे। सवाल-7: अभी अमेरिका में कितने अवैध भारतीय अप्रवासी बचे हैं और क्या उन्हें भी डिपोर्ट किया जाएगा?जवाब: मीडिया रिपोर्ट्स के मुताबिक, अमेरिका में अभी 20,407 अवैध भारतीय अप्रवासी ऐसे हैं जिन्हें डिपोर्टेशन का सामना करना पड़ रहा है। इनमें से 17,940 भारतीय लोगों को निकालने के लिए अंतिम आदेश जारी किया जा चुका है। वहीं 2,467 भारतीयों को अमेरिकी इमिग्रेशन विभाग (ICE) ने हिरासत में ले रखा है। प्यू रिसर्च सेंटर की 2022 की रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, अमेरिका में लगभग 7.25 लाख अवैध भारतीय अप्रवासी रहते हैं। यह आंकड़ा अवैध प्रवासियों की तीसरी सबसे बड़ी संख्या है। सवाल-8: इस डिपोर्टेशन में कितना खर्च आया और क्या ये रकम भारत चुका रहा है?जवाब: अप्रवासियों के लौटने का खर्च भारत नहीं, बल्कि ट्रम्प सरकार उठा रही है। ग्लोबमास्टर C-17 के भारत का एक चक्कर लगाने में करीब 6 करोड़ रुपए का खर्च आया है। ये सामान्य चार्टर्ड उड़ान से लगभग छह गुना ज्यादा है। आज 104 लोगों को C-17 सैन्य विमान से भेजने का खर्च 6 करोड़ रुपए रहा। यानी एक व्यक्ति का खर्च 5.76 लाख रुपए है। अमेरिका को 20 हजार अवैध अप्रवासियों को भारत भेजने के लिए 1.2 हजार करोड़ रुपए खर्च करने होंगे। इसके लिए C-17 सैन्य विमान को लगभग 193 चक्कर लगाने होंगे। अमेरिकी रक्षा विभाग डिपार्टमेंट ऑफ डिफेंस (DOD) अप्रवासियों को हटाने की मुहिम में 4 मिलिट्री एयरक्राफ्ट्स का इस्तेमाल कर रही है। इनमें दो C-17 और दो C-130E विमान शामिल हैं। रिसर्च सहयोग- गंधर्व झा -------------- अमेरिका
