            "description": "Danone's Bold Move: Ditching Artificial Dyes for Healthier U.S. Yogurt Danone, the yogurt giant, is planning to eliminate artificial dyes from its U.S. products amidst growing health concerns and regulatory scrutiny. Shane Grant, CEO of Danone's Americas business, confirmed the initiative, aligning it with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s agenda to boost national health.Only 2% of Danone's U.S. portfolio contains artificial dyes, with popular items like Yo Crunch vanilla yogurt with M&Ms using them. The move is seen as a proactive step given increasing consumer awareness and related policy changes across American states.The Consumer Brands Association has also highlighted the industry's shift towards dye-free products. Despite reports of Kennedy's understanding with food manufacturers, no formal agreement exists. States like Arizona and West Virginia have already banned such dyes in school food, underscoring the trend's momentum.",

            "description": "Trump's Executive Order Targets NPR and PBS Funding President Donald Trump's administration has issued an executive order to eliminate federal funding for NPR and PBS, two key U.S. broadcasters. The decision is part of the administration's strategy to sanction organizations it perceives as political adversaries.The order demands that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting halt direct funding to PBS and NPR. While NPR plans to contest the order legally, PBS is exploring possible courses of action. Currently, a significant portion of their funding originates from non-federal sources, with Congress having already allocated $535 million to CPB for fiscal year 2025.The White House justifies the funding cuts by accusing NPR and PBS of using taxpayer money to promote indoctrination disguised as news. However, CPB's Patricia Harrison argues that Congress, not the president, has the authority over this funding. Civil liberties advocates express worries about potential impacts on free speech, as NPR and PBS explore alternatives to maintain their programming integrity.",

            "description": "Miami GP Secures Historic 10-Year F1 Extension In a significant move for Formula One's expansion in the United States, the Miami Grand Prix has secured a contract extension until 2041, making it the longest-running event on the F1 calendar.Formula One chief Stefano Domenicali hailed the agreement as an essential strategic milestone, emphasizing its role in the sport's growth, particularly in the booming U.S. market fueled by the popularity of Netflix's 'Drive to Survive' series. Domenicali underlined the importance of solidifying F1's presence in the States as a part of a broader expansion strategy.Red Bull's Christian Horner acknowledged the extension's lengthy duration, but noted its potential to fortify Formula One's position in America. Miami GP promoter Tom Garfinkel highlighted the local economic and cultural benefits, predicting a surge in fanbase growth and positioning Miami as a prominent motorsport hub.",

Experts, including Mel Robbins and researchers from the University of Oxford, explain that this habit confuses the brain by restarting sleep cycles it can’t complete, which may impact stress levels, immunity, and inflammation. Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and waking up naturally is recommended for better overall health.",

            "description": "Kuwait is cracking down on cryptocurrency miners throughout the country, as reported by Reuters. Officials have blamed the practice for blackouts and for causing stress on its power grid. The country started this crackdown just before the onset of summer, which experts say could reach scorching temperatures of 125 degrees Fahrenheit.Kuwait’s Ministry of Interior said in a statement that it has been conducting a \"wide-ranging\" security operation that targets homes suspected of being used for cryptocurrency mining. The government agency went on to say that crypto mining is illegal, as the country’s Capital Markets Authority banned the practice in 2023. Crypto trading was also banned at that time.The crackdown has been targeting homes in the Al-Wafrah region of Kuwait, which is located in the southern part of the country. The region’s electricity ministry has said that around 100 homes were being used for mining operations, often consuming up to 20 times the normal power levels. To that end, energy consumption in the area dropped by 55 percent following the operation, according to a government statement.It’s no secret that cryptocurrency mining gobbles up vast amounts of computing power and, as such, electricity. Kuwait isn’t the only country to regulate or outright ban the practice. Russia has banned crypto mining in several regions throughout the country. Kosovo outlawed the practice back in 2022 and Angola did the same in 2024. European countries like Iceland and Norway have strictly regulated the industry due to energy shortages.As for Kuwait, researchers at the University of Cambridge estimated that the country was responsible for just 0.05 percent of the world's bitcoin mining in 2022. Alex de Vries-Gao, founder of a research project that tracks crypto energy use, told Reuters that \"it only takes a very small share of the total bitcoin mining network to have a significant impact on the relatively small total electricity consumption of Kuwait.\"Recent data indicates that crypto mining accounts for almost 2.5 percent of the total energy consumption of the US. That’s approximately half of the energy used by the entire commercial sector of the US economy. But hey, at least we get some fake coins we can’t buy anything with for our trouble.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/kuwait-cracks-down-on-crypto-miners-to-cut-down-on-electricity-usage-161200772.html?src=rss",

            "description": "Supreme Court to Review Controversial UP Conversion Law The Supreme Court has decided to review a plea challenging the constitutionality of the 2024 amendments to Uttar Pradesh's law on unlawful religious conversion. Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justices Sanjay Kumar and K V Viswanathan noted arguments by senior lawyer S Muralidhar, who described sections of the Act as 'vague and overly broad', and claimed they violate free speech and religious propagation rights.The plea, submitted by Roop Rekha Verma among others, argues that the law's ambiguous wording violates Articles 14, 19, 21, and 25 of the Constitution by enabling arbitrary enforcement and lacking clear standards. The presumption of malintent behind conversions and a lack of procedural safeguards are central to the concerns raised.Challengers also argue the amendment expands who can file complaints without adequate procedural safeguards, disproportionately affects individuals practicing their faith, and risks wrongful prosecution. The Court will hear these arguments alongside other similar petitions on May 13, scrutinizing the law's alignment with constitutional rights.",

            "description": "SEBI ने ओला इलेक्ट्रिक के खिलाफ इनसाइडर ट्रेडिंग के आरोपों की जांच शुरू की है। एनडीटीवी की रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, ओला इलेक्ट्रिक ने अक्टूबर-दिसंबर 2024 के बीच इनसाइडर ट्रेडिंग और रिलेटेड पार्टी डील्स में नियमों का उलंघन किया है। यह मामला तब सामने आया, जब पहले ही ओला पर फरवरी 2025 की सेल्स रिपोर्ट में गड़बड़ी के आरोप लग चुके हैं। दरअसल, फरवरी 2025 में कंपनी ने दावा किया था कि उसने 25,000 इलेक्ट्रिक व्हीकल बेचे और इलेक्ट्रिक टू-व्हीलर में 28% मार्केट शेयर हासिल किया था। लेकिन सरकारी वेबसाइट VAHAN पर दर्ज आकड़ों के अनुसार फरवरी में ओला के सिर्फ 8,600 वाहनों का ही रजिस्ट्रेशन हुआ था। इस बड़े अंतर पर सेबी जांच कर रही है। केंद्रीय परिवहन मंत्रालय भी नोटिस दे चुका इससे पहले 25 अप्रैल को केंद्रीय परिवहन मंत्रालय ने ओला को शो-कॉज नोटिस जारी किया था। मंत्रालय ने 7 दिन के अंदर कई अहम सवालों के जवाब मांगे थे। नोटिस में ओला से इन सवालों के जवाब मांगे 22 अप्रैल को महाराष्ट्र में 121 स्टोर्स पर कार्रवाई के निर्देश दिए थे तीन दिन पहले महाराष्ट्र में ट्रांसपोर्ट विभाग ने ओला के 121 स्टोर्स बंद करने के निर्देश दिए हैं। ट्रांसपोर्ट विभाग ने ओला के 146 स्टोर्स की जांच की थी, इनमें 121 से ज्यादा स्टोर्स बिना ट्रेड सर्टिफिकेट के चल रहे थे। दरअसल, पिछले महीने RTO ने महाराष्ट्र में ओला के कई स्टोर्स पर छापेमारी की थी। स्टोर्स पर ट्रेड सर्टिफिकेट नहीं होने के चलते 192 व्हीकल्स को जब्त कर कारण बताओ नोटिस दिए गए थे। ओला इलेक्ट्रिक का शेयर 1 साल में 46% गिरा शुक्रवार को ओला इलेक्ट्रिक शेयर 0.33% की गिरवट के साथ 48.53 रुपए पर बंद हुआ। एक महीने में ओला का शेयर 10% से ज्यादा गिरा है। वहीं पिछले एक साल में शेयर 45% से ज्यादा टूटा है। ओला का मार्केट कैपिटल 22.14 हजार करोड़ रुपए है। ओला के स्टोर पर 4 बार हुई रेड ओला के स्टोर्स पर देशभर में RTO कार्रवाई हुई थी। अब तक महाराष्ट्र और मध्यप्रदेश के 32 स्टोर्स पर रेड पड़ चुकी है। इसके अलावा राजस्थान में कुछ स्टोर्स पर भी कार्रवाई की गई है। इसमें 50 से ज्यादा इलेक्ट्रिक गाड़ियों को जब्त किया जा चुका है। दूसरी कंपनियों की शिकायत के बाद कार्रवाई गुरुग्राम की प्रताप सिंह एंड एसोसिएट्स कंपनी ने ओला इलेक्ट्रिक और कुछ अन्य कंपनियों के खिलाफ ट्रेड सर्टिफिकेट नहीं होने की शिकायत दर्ज कराई थी। शिकायत के बाद महाराष्ट्र के ट्रांसपोर्ट अधिकारियों ने कार्रवाई की । ओला इलेक्ट्रिक ने कहा- रेड की कार्रवाई गलत और पक्षपातपूर्ण रेड की कार्रवाई पर ओला इलेक्ट्रिक के प्रवक्ता ने बताया था कि कोई वाहन जब्त नहीं किया गया है। इससे पहले ओला ने जांच को गलत और पक्षपातपूर्ण बताया था। प्रवक्ता ने कहा था कई राज्यों में ओला के डिस्ट्रीब्यूशन सेंटर्स और गोदामों में अनरजिस्टर्ड व्हीकल्स की इन्वेंट्री है। ये मोटर व्हीकल एक्ट के दिशानिर्देशों का पूरी तरह से पालन करती है और जरूरी मंजूरियां मौजूद हैं। कंपनी ने स्टोर्स पर रेड को लेकर कोई जानकारी नहीं दी थी।",

            "description": "BJP MP Claims Pakistan Behind Disappearance of 10,000 People Nishikant Dubey, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Member of Parliament, has made startling accusations against Pakistan, claiming that the Pakistan Army colluded with terrorists Hafiz Saeed and Dawood Ibrahim to eliminate Baluchis and protesters, resulting in the disappearance of approximately 10,000 individuals.Dubey's allegations come at a time of escalated diplomatic tension between India and Pakistan following the Pahalgam terrorist attack, which claimed 26 lives. In response to these developments, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's joint general secretary, Krishna Gopal, discussed the prevailing 'intolerance' in Pakistan, emphasizing the lack of social cohesion among various ethnic communities there.Addressing concerns during a book launch, RSS leader Krishna Gopal commented on the persisting divisions within Pakistan. Meanwhile, the Indian government has announced a series of retaliatory actions, including suspending the Indus Water Treaty to address Pakistan's support for terrorism. Union Home Minister Amit Shah reiterated the government's zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism, vowing to eradicate it entirely. (ANI)",

His arrest took place in Shamsher Nagar, Dhanbad, amid an ongoing investigation into the Jharkhand module of Hizb ut-Tahrir.Ammar, once jailed by Jodhpur Police in 2014, served a decade before securing bail in May 2024. Post-release, he allegedly resumed contact with Hizb ut-Tahrir operatives, uncovered during the recent interrogation of Ayan Javed by ATS, which led to his capture.This operation intensified on April 26, resulting in the arrest of four individuals with alleged links to Hizb ut-Tahrir and Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS). The ATS, acting on intelligence cues, recovered illegal arms and extremist materials, marking the first case post-HuT's 2024 ban under the UAPA Act.",

            "description": "Tensions Escalate Along India-Pakistan Border After Ceasefire Violations The Indian military has responded effectively to unprovoked small arms firing by the Pakistan Army across the Line of Control (LoC) on the night of May 1-2. The clashes occurred in areas opposite Kupwara, Baramulla, and Poonch districts, as well as the Naushera and Akhnoor sectors of Jammu and Kashmir, according to officials.This marks the eighth consecutive day of India's precise retaliations since the Pakistan Army's initial firing on April 25-26. The Indian Army remains resolute in its response, countering attacks across multiple regions including Kupwara, Uri, and Akhnoor sectors.Meanwhile, heightened security measures are underway in Jammu and Kashmir's Rajouri district following a recent terrorist attack. Joint search operations continue in various forests and along the borders to locate suspected terrorists.Security forces have set up vehicle check posts for thorough inspection of suspicious vehicles on highways and roads. Recently, the Director General of Military Operations from both countries engaged in talks over the hotline regarding Pakistan’s ceasefire violations, as per defense sources.India has issued a stern warning to Pakistan over these violations along the LoC and has imposed an airspace closure for all Pakistani-registered aircraft. The Ministry of Civil Aviation confirmed the closure, effective from April 30 to May 23, as a response to the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam where 26 people perished.",

            "description": "हम सभी ट्रेन से यात्रा करते हैं। सफर के दौरान अक्सर ही हमारा सामना TTE और RPF से होता रहता है। कई बार हम अनजाने में या किसी मजबूरी में बिना टिकट यात्रा करते हैं और पकड़े जाने पर घबरा जाते हैं। इसकी वजह यह होती है कि हमें अपने कानूनी अधिकारों की जानकारी नहीं होती है। ऐसे में हम TTE या आरपीएफ द्वारा बताए गई हर बात को सही मान लेते हैं और ऐसे में जैसा वे कहते हैं, हम वैसा ही करते हैं। जबकि हमारे भी कुछ कानूनी अधिकार होते हैं। आज हम जानें अपने अधिकार कॉलम में ट्रेन में यात्रा करने के दौरान अपने अधिकार के बारे में बात करेंगे और साथ ही जानेंगे कि- सवाल- अगर मैं बिना टिकट ट्रेन में यात्रा कर रहा हूं और TTE पकड़ ले तो क्या मुझे गिरफ्तार किया जा सकता है? जवाब- नहीं, TTE आपको सीधे गिरफ्तार नहीं कर सकता है। हालांकि, बिना टिकट यात्रा करना भारतीय रेलवे के नियमों के खिलाफ है। ऐसा करने पर जुर्माना लगाया जा सकता है। सवाल- क्या बिना टिकट यात्रा करने पर TTE मनमाना जुर्माना वसूल सकते हैं? जवाब- नहीं, TTE आपसे मनमाना जुर्माना नहीं वसूल सकते हैं। बिना टिकट यात्रा करने पर जुर्माने की राशि ट्रेन, ट्रैवल क्लास, दूरी और अन्य कारणों पर निर्भर करती है। आइए इसे ग्राफिक के जरिए समझते हैं। सवाल- अगर TTE ने प मनमाना जुर्माना लगाया, तो क्या मैं शिकायत कर सकता हूं? जवाब- हां, अगर आपको लगता है कि TTE ने जुर्माना अनुचित तरीके से लगाया है, तो आप 155210 पर मैसेज करके या 139 पर कॉल करके शिकायत कर सकते हैं। आप रेलवे के अधिकारियों से से शिकायत कर सकते हैं। सवाल- जुर्माना देने से इंकार करने पर क्या हो सकता है? जवाब- अगर आप जुर्माना देने के लिए तैयार नहीं होते हैं, तो रेलवे अधिनियम के अंतर्गत आपको अगले स्टेशन पर गाड़ी से उतारा जा सकता है। या मुकदमा भी चलाया जा सकता है। इसमें आपको एक माह की सजा या 500 रुपए का जुर्माना या दोनों हो सकते हैं। वहीं अगर कोई यात्री TTE के साथ अभद्रता करता है, उत्पात मचाता है और रेलवे के नियमों का उल्लघंन करता है, तो TTE रेलवे पुलिस को सूचित कर सकता है। इसके बाद रेलवे पुलिस (RPF) आपको गिरफ्तार कर कार्रवाई कर सकती है। जिसके बाद कोर्ट आपको रेलवे अधिनियम 139 के तहत 6 माह की सजा सुना सकती है। सवाल- अगर मुझे बिना टिकट पकड़ा जाता है, तो क्या मुझे रेलवे पुलिस के हवाले कर सकती है? जवाब- नहीं, TTE आपसे सिर्फ जुर्माने की राशि भरने के लिए कहेगा। यदि आपने जुर्माना नहीं भरा या अगर आप TTE के साथ सहयोग नहीं करते हैं, तो TTE आपको रेलवे पुलिस के हवाले कर सकता है। सवाल- क्या बिना टिकट यात्रा करने पर मुझे जेल हो सकती है? जवाब- बिना टिकट यात्रा करना एक सिविल अपराध की श्रेणी में आता है। इसमें आमतौर पर जुर्माना वसूला जाता है। अगर आप जुर्माना भर देते हैं, तो आपको जेल नहीं होगी। सवाल- अगर मैं यात्रा के दौरान बिना टिकट पकड़ लिया जाता हूं, तो क्या मुझे ट्रेन से उतारा जा सकता है? जवाब- आमतौर पर ऐसा नहीं किया जाता है। हालांकि, कुछ परिस्थितियों में ऐसा हो सकता है। आइए इसे ग्राफिक के जरिए समझते हैं। सवाल- बिना टिकट यात्रा करने के बाद अगर जुर्माना नहीं भरता हूं, तो TTE क्या कदम उठा सकता है? जवाब- अगर आपने जुर्माना नहीं भरा, तो TTE आपके खिलाफ एक कानूनी प्रक्रिया शुरू कर सकता है। वह आपको रेलवे पुलिस के पास भेज सकता है। रेलवे पुलिस उस स्थिति का मूल्यांकन करेगी और अगर मामला हल नहीं होता है, तो आपको रेलवे कोर्ट में पेश किया जा सकता है। रेलवे कोर्ट में आपको सुनवाई का अवसर मिलेगा वहां, आप अपनी बात रख सकते हैं। इसके बाद कोर्ट फैसला करेगी। फैसले के आधार पर जुर्माना या सजा हो सकती है। सवाल- क्या बिना टिकट यात्रा करना सिविल अपराध है या आपराधिक अपराध? जवाब- बिना टिकट यात्रा एक सिविल अपराध है, न कि आपराधिक अपराध। इसका मतलब है कि इसके लिए आपको जुर्माना भरना पड़ सकता है। मामला अदालत में सुलझाया जा सकता है। हालांकि, अगर आप यात्रा के दौरान कानून तोड़ते हैं, जैसे कि पुलिस से मारपीट करना या कोर्ट का आदेश न मानना, तो यह आपराधिक अपराध बन सकता है, जिसके लिए सजा और जेल हो सकती है। सवाल- क्या बिना टिकट यात्रा के मामले में वकील की मदद की आवश्यकता हो सकती है? जवाब- बिना टिकट यात्रा के सामान्य मामलों में वकील की मदद की आवश्यकता नहीं होती, क्योंकि यह एक सिविल मामला है। लेकिन अगर मामला अदालत में पहुंच जाता है और आपको लगता है कि जुर्माना अनुचित है या आपको अन्य कानूनी मदद की जरूरत है, तो आप वकील की मदद ले सकते हैं। वकील आपके अधिकारों की रक्षा करेगा और आपको कानूनी प्रक्रियाओं को समझाने में मदद करेगा।'जानें अपने अधिकार' से जुड़ी ये खबर भी पढ़ेंजानें अपने अधिकार- ITR न भरने पर क्या होगा:जानें कौन से नोटिस का क्या अर्थ, जानें कैसे जुर्माने से बचें इनकम टैक्स एक्ट, 1961 के सेक्शन 139 के मुताबिक, भारत में अगर आपकी आय टैक्स के दायरे में आती है तो इनकम टैक्स रिटर्न (ITR) फाइल करना जरूरी है। कई बार लोग इसे समय पर फाइल नहीं कर पाते या फाइल करते समय कुछ छोटी-मोटी गलतियां कर बैठते हैं। इससे रिफंड रुक जाता है और कभी-कभी इनकम टैक्स डिपार्टमेंट से नोटिस भी आ जाता है। पूरी खबर पढ़िए...",

            "description": "IPL 2025 MI vs RR: कर्ण शर्मा और ट्रेंट बोल्ट की शानदार गेंदबाजी के दम पर मुंबई इंडियंस (एमआई) ने आईपीएल 2025 में अपनी लगातार छठी जीत दर्ज की और सवाई मानसिंह स्टेडियम में राजस्थान रॉयल्स (आरआर) को 100 रनों के विशाल अंतर से हराकर अंक तालिका में शीर्ष स्थान हासिल कर लिया.मुंबई ने पहले बल्लेबाजी करते हुए 217/2 का विशाल स्कोर खड़ा किया, जिसमें रयान रिकेल्टन और रोहित शर्मा की अर्धशतकीय पारियों के साथ-साथ सूर्यकुमार यादव और कप्तान हार्दिक पांड्या के नाबाद 48-48 रनों का योगदान रहा. इसके बाद एमआई की गेंदबाजी ने आरआर को 16.1 ओवर में मात्र 117 रनों पर समेट दिया, जिससे जयपुर में उनकी 2012 के बाद पहली जीत दर्ज हुई.मुंबई की इस शानदार जीत ने उनकी नेट रन रेट को 1.274 तक पहुंचा दिया, जो टूर्नामेंट में सर्वश्रेष्ठ है. दूसरी ओर, इस करारी हार ने राजस्थान रॉयल्स को आईपीएल 2025 से बाहर कर दिया. 217 रनों के विशाल लक्ष्य का बचाव करने उतरी एमआई ने शुरू से ही आरआर पर दबाव बनाए रखा. दीपक चाहर ने युवा वैभव सूर्यवंशी को, जिन्होंने पिछले मैच में 35 गेंदों में शतक जड़ा था, दो गेंदों में शून्य पर मिड-ऑन पर कैच आउट कराया. यशस्वी जायसवाल ने ट्रेंट बोल्ट के खिलाफ दो छक्के जड़े, लेकिन बोल्ट ने उसी ओवर में उनकी गिल्लियां बिखेर दीं.नितीश राणा अगले शिकार बने, जिन्होंने बोल्ट की गेंद पर डीप स्क्वायर लेग को कैच थमाया. रियान पराग को लगातार शॉर्ट गेंदों से परेशान किया गया और आखिरकार उन्होंने जसप्रीत बुमराह की गेंद पर मिड-विकेट को टॉप-एज दे दिया. बुमराह ने अगली ही गेंद पर शिमरन हेटमायर को भी मिड-विकेट पर कैच आउट कराया. पावरप्ले में आरआर 62/5 पर सिमट गई। शुभम दुबे ने नौ गेंदों में 15 रन बनाकर कुछ प्रतिरोध दिखाया, लेकिन हार्दिक पांड्या ने उन्हें लॉन्ग-ऑन पर कैच आउट करा दिया. ध्रुव जुरेल ने कर्ण शर्मा की गेंद पर पैडल स्वीप की कोशिश की, लेकिन ग्लव्स से लगकर गेंद कर्ण के हाथों में चली गई, जो इम्पैक्ट प्लेयर के रूप में आए थे.कर्ण ने 12वें ओवर में दो विकेट लेकर आरआर की कमर तोड़ दी, जबकि बोल्ट ने जोफ्रा आर्चर (30) को शॉर्ट फाइन लेग पर कैच आउट कराकर पारी का अंत किया। इस जीत ने एमआई की स्थिति को और मजबूत कर दिया.संक्षिप्त स्कोर: मुंबई इंडियंस 217/2 (रयान रिकेल्टन 61, रोहित शर्मा 53; रियान पराग 1-12) ने राजस्थान रॉयल्स 117 (जोफ्रा आर्चर 30, रियान पराग 16; कर्ण शर्मा 3-23, ट्रेंट बोल्ट 3-28) को 100 रनों से हराया.",
